# This workflow will sync changes in the release candidate branch to master during a
# feature freeze. The action is run daily and will only create a pull request when
# there exists a release candidate branch corresponding to the current package version
# as declared in pennylane/_version.py, that is if the branch "v0.23.0-rc0" exists while
# the package version is "v0.24.0-dev".
