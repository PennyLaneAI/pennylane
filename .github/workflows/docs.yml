# Sphinx docs check
# -----------------
#
# There are 2 main reasons for having this dedicated Sphinx docs check in
# addition to the Read the Docs (RTD) builder:
#
# 1. This action is set up to fail on Sphinx warnings, whereas RTD's will show
# a passing sign for warnings, and only fail for errors. So this is a stricter
# check.
#
# 2. When this action detects warnings, it produces GitHub annotations on the
# Files Changed tab in the pull request. Such annotations can be convenient for
# developers/code reviewers (e.g., the same way CodeCov and CodeFactor
# annotate).
