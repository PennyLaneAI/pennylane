# Release 0.10.0 (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Adds a new device, `default.qubit.tf`, a pure-state qubit simulator written using TensorFlow.
  As a result, it supports classical backpropagation as a means to compute the Jacobian. This can
  be faster than the parameter-shift rule for analytic quantum gradients
  when the number of parameters to be optimized is large.

  `default.qubit.tf` is designed to be used with end-to-end classical backpropagation
  (`diff_method="backprop"`) with the TensorFlow interface. This is the default method
  of differentiation when creating a QNode with this device.

  Using this method, the created QNode is a 'white-box' that is
  tightly integrated with your TensorFlow computation, including
  [AutoGraph](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function) support:

  ```pycon
  >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit.tf", wires=1)
  >>> @tf.function
  ... @qml.qnode(dev, interface="tf", diff_method="backprop")
  ... def circuit(x):
  ...     qml.RX(x[1], wires=0)
  ...     qml.Rot(x[0], x[1], x[2], wires=0)
  ...     return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  >>> weights = tf.Variable([0.2, 0.5, 0.1])
  >>> with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  ...     res = circuit(weights)
  >>> print(tape.gradient(res, weights))
  tf.Tensor([-2.2526717e-01 -1.0086454e+00  1.3877788e-17], shape=(3,), dtype=float32)
  ```

  See the `default.qubit.tf`
  [documentation](https://pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.beta.plugins.DefaultQubitTF.html)
  for more details.

* Contains the new template `UCCSD` implementing the Unitary Coupled-Cluster (UCCSD) ansatz
  to perform VQE-based quantum chemistry simulations using PennyLane-QChem.
  [(#654)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/654)

* PennyLane QNodes can now be converted into Torch layers, allowing for creation of quantum and
  hybrid models using the `torch.nn` API.
  [(#588)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/588)

  A PennyLane QNode can be converted into a `torch.nn` layer using the `qml.qnn.TorchLayer` class:

  ```python
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def qnode(inputs, weights_0, weight_1):
     # define the circuit
     # ...

  weight_shapes = {"weights_0": 3, "weight_1": 1}
  qlayer = qml.qnn.TorchLayer(qnode, weight_shapes)
  ```

  A hybrid model can then be easily constructed:

  ```python
  model = torch.nn.Sequential(qlayer, torch.nn.Linear(2, 2))
  ```

* Contains the new template `DoubleExcitationUnitary` implementing the quantum circuit to
  exponentiate the Coupled-Cluster double excitation operator. This template is required to
  build the Unitary Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz for VQE simulations.
  [(#638)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/638)
  [(#659)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/659)

* Contains the new template `SingleExcitationUnitary` implementing the quantum circuit to
  exponentiate the Coupled-Cluster single excitation operator. This template is required to
  build the Unitary Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz for VQE simulations.
  [(#622)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/622)
  [(#659)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/659)

* Added module `pennylane.qnn.cost` with class `SquaredErrorLoss`. The module will contain classes
  to calculate losses and costs on circuits with trainable parameters.
  [(#642)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/642)


<h3>Improvements</h3>

* The `CircuitGraph` class now supports serializing contained circuit operations
  and measurement basis rotations to an OpenQASM2.0 script via the new
  `CircuitGraph.to_openqasm()` method.
  [(#623)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/623)

* The QNode Torch interface now inspects QNode positional arguments.
  If any argument does not have the attribute `requires_grad=True`, it
  is automatically excluded from quantum gradient computations.
  [(#652)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/652)
  [(#660)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/660)

* The QNode TF interface now inspects QNode positional arguments.
  If any argument is not being watched by a `tf.GradientTape()`,
  it is automatically excluded from quantum gradient computations.
  [(#655)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/655)
  [(#660)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/660)

* QNodes have two new public methods: `QNode.set_trainable_args()` and `QNode.get_trainable_args()`.
  These are designed to be called by interfaces, to specify to the QNode which of its
  input arguments are differentiable. Arguments which are non-differentiable will not be converted
  to PennyLane Variable objects within the QNode.
  [(#660)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/660)

* A significant refactor with respect to how QNodes and interfaces mark quantum function
  arguments as differentiable when using Autograd, designed to improve performance and make
  QNodes more intuitive.
  [(#648)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/648)
  [(#650)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/650)

  In particular, the following changes have been made:

  - A new `ndarray` subclass `pennylane.numpy.tensor`, which extends NumPy arrays with
    the keyword argument and attribute `requires_grad`. Tensors which have `requires_grad=False`
    are treated as non-differentiable by the Autograd interface.

  - A new subpackage `pennylane.numpy`, which wraps `autograd.numpy` such that NumPy functions
    accept the `requires_grad` keyword argument, and allows Autograd to differentiate
    `pennylane.numpy.tensor` objects.

  - The `argnum` argument to `qml.grad` is now optional; if not provided, arguments explicitly
    marked as `requires_grad=False` are excluded for the list of differentiable arguments.
    The ability to pass `argnum` has been retained for backwards compatibility, and
    if present the old behaviour persists.

# Release 0.9.0 (current release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h4>New machine learning integrations</h4>

* PennyLane QNodes can now be converted into Keras layers, allowing for creation of quantum and
  hybrid models using the Keras API.
  [(#529)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/529)

  A PennyLane QNode can be converted into a Keras layer using the `KerasLayer` class:

  ```python
  from pennylane.qnn import KerasLayer

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(inputs, weights_0, weight_1):
     # define the circuit
     # ...

  weight_shapes = {"weights_0": 3, "weight_1": 1}
  qlayer = qml.qnn.KerasLayer(circuit, weight_shapes, output_dim=2)
  ```

  A hybrid model can then be easily constructed:

  ```python
  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([qlayer, tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)])
  ```

* Added a new type of QNode, `qml.qnodes.PassthruQNode`. For simulators which are coded in an
  external library which supports automatic differentiation, PennyLane will treat a PassthruQNode as
  a "white box", and rely on the external library to directly provide gradients via backpropagation.
  This can be more efficient than the using parameter-shift rule for a large number of parameters.
  [(#488)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/488)

  Currently this behaviour is supported by PennyLane's `default.tensor.tf` device backend,
  compatible with the `'tf'` interface using TensorFlow 2:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device('default.tensor.tf', wires=2)

  @qml.qnode(dev, diff_method="backprop")
  def circuit(params):
      qml.RX(params[0], wires=0)
      qml.RX(params[1], wires=1)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

  qnode = PassthruQNode(circuit, dev)
  params = tf.Variable([0.3, 0.1])

  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      tape.watch(params)
      res = qnode(params)

  grad = tape.gradient(res, params)
  ```

<h4>New optimizers</h4>

* Added the `qml.RotosolveOptimizer`, a gradient-free optimizer
  that minimizes the quantum function by updating each parameter,
  one-by-one, via a closed-form expression while keeping other parameters
  fixed.
  [(#636)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/636)
  [(#539)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/539)

* Added the `qml.RotoselectOptimizer`, which uses Rotosolve to
  minimizes a quantum function with respect to both the
  rotation operations applied and the rotation parameters.
  [(#636)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/636)
  [(#539)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/539)

  For example, given a quantum function `f` that accepts parameters `x`
  and a list of corresponding rotation operations `generators`,
  the Rotoselect optimizer will, at each step, update both the parameter
  values and the list of rotation gates to minimize the loss:

  ```pycon
  >>> opt = qml.optimize.RotoselectOptimizer()
  >>> x = [0.3, 0.7]
  >>> generators = [qml.RX, qml.RY]
  >>> for _ in range(100):
  ...     x, generators = opt.step(f, x, generators)
  ```


<h4>New operations</h4>

* Added the `PauliRot` gate, which performs an arbitrary
  Pauli rotation on multiple qubits, and the `MultiRZ` gate,
  which performs a rotation generated by a tensor product
  of Pauli Z operators.
  [(#559)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/559)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=4)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(angle):
      qml.PauliRot(angle, "IXYZ", wires=[0, 1, 2, 3])
      return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wire)) for wire in [0, 1, 2, 3]]
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(0.4)
  [1.         0.92106099 0.92106099 1.        ]
  >>> print(circuit.draw())
   0: ──╭RI(0.4)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
   1: ──├RX(0.4)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
   2: ──├RY(0.4)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
   3: ──╰RZ(0.4)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
  ```

  If the `PauliRot` gate is not supported on the target device, it will
  be decomposed into `Hadamard`, `RX` and `MultiRZ` gates. Note that
  identity gates in the Pauli word result in untouched wires:

  ```pycon
  >>> print(circuit.draw())
   0: ───────────────────────────────────┤ ⟨Z⟩
   1: ──H──────────╭RZ(0.4)──H───────────┤ ⟨Z⟩
   2: ──RX(1.571)──├RZ(0.4)──RX(-1.571)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
   3: ─────────────╰RZ(0.4)──────────────┤ ⟨Z⟩
  ```

  If the `MultiRZ` gate is not supported, it will be decomposed into
  `CNOT` and `RZ` gates:

  ```pycon
  >>> print(circuit.draw())
   0: ──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ ⟨Z⟩
   1: ──H──────────────╭X──RZ(0.4)──╭X──────H───────────┤ ⟨Z⟩
   2: ──RX(1.571)──╭X──╰C───────────╰C──╭X──RX(-1.571)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
   3: ─────────────╰C───────────────────╰C──────────────┤ ⟨Z⟩
  ```

* PennyLane now provides `DiagonalQubitUnitary` for diagonal gates, that are e.g.,
  encountered in IQP circuits. These kinds of gates can be evaluated much faster on
  a simulator device.
  [(#567)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/567)

  The gate can be used, for example, to efficiently simulate oracles:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=3)

  # Function as a bitstring
  f = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0])

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(weights1, weights2):
      qml.templates.StronglyEntanglingLayers(weights1, wires=[0, 1, 2])

      # Implements the function as a phase-kickback oracle
      qml.DiagonalQubitUnitary((-1)**f, wires=[0, 1, 2])

      qml.templates.StronglyEntanglingLayers(weights2, wires=[0, 1, 2])
      return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(w)) for w in range(3)]
  ```

* Added the `TensorN` CVObservable that can represent the tensor product of the
  `NumberOperator` on photonic backends.
  [(#608)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/608)

<h4>New templates</h4>

* Added the `ArbitraryUnitary` and `ArbitraryStatePreparation` templates, which use
  `PauliRot` gates to perform an arbitrary unitary and prepare an arbitrary basis
  state with the minimal number of parameters.
  [(#590)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/590)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=3)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(weights1, weights2):
        qml.templates.ArbitraryStatePreparation(weights1, wires=[0, 1, 2])
        qml.templates.ArbitraryUnitary(weights2, wires=[0, 1, 2])
        return qml.probs(wires=[0, 1, 2])
  ```

* Added the `IQPEmbedding` template, which encodes inputs into the diagonal gates of an
  IQP circuit.
  [(#605)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/605)

  <img src="https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/iqp.png"
  width=50%></img>

* Added the ``SimplifiedTwoDesign`` template, which implements the circuit
  design of [Cerezo et al. (2020)](<https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00550>).
  [(#556)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/556)

  <img src="https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/simplified_two_design.png"
  width=50%></img>

* Added the ``BasicEntanglerLayers`` template, which is a simple layer architecture
  of rotations and CNOT nearest-neighbour entanglers.
  [(#555)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/555)

  <img src="https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/basic_entangler.png"
  width=50%></img>

* PennyLane now offers a broadcasting function to easily construct templates:
  `qml.broadcast()` takes single quantum operations or other templates and applies
  them to wires in a specific pattern.
  [(#515)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/515)
  [(#522)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/522)
  [(#526)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/526)
  [(#603)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/603)

  For example, we can use broadcast to repeat a custom template
  across multiple wires:

  ```python
  from pennylane.templates import template

  @template
  def mytemplate(pars, wires):
      qml.Hadamard(wires=wires)
      qml.RY(pars, wires=wires)

  dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=3)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(pars):
      qml.broadcast(mytemplate, pattern="single", wires=[0,1,2], parameters=pars)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit([1, 1, 0.1])
  -0.841470984807896
  >>> print(circuit.draw())
   0: ──H──RY(1.0)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
   1: ──H──RY(1.0)──┤
   2: ──H──RY(0.1)──┤
  ```

  For other available patterns, see the
  [broadcast function documentation](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/api/pennylane.broadcast.html).

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* The `QAOAEmbedding` now uses the new `MultiRZ` gate as a `ZZ` entangler,
  which changes the convention. While
  previously, the `ZZ` gate in the embedding was implemented as

  ```python
  CNOT(wires=[wires[0], wires[1]])
  RZ(2 * parameter, wires=wires[0])
  CNOT(wires=[wires[0], wires[1]])
  ```

  the `MultiRZ` corresponds to

  ```python
  CNOT(wires=[wires[1], wires[0]])
  RZ(parameter, wires=wires[0])
  CNOT(wires=[wires[1], wires[0]])
  ```

  which differs in the factor of `2`, and fixes a bug in the
  wires that the `CNOT` was applied to.
  [(#609)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/609)

* Probability methods are handled by `QubitDevice` and device method
  requirements are modified to simplify plugin development.
  [(#573)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/573)

* The internal variables `All` and `Any` to mark an `Operation` as acting on all or any
  wires have been renamed to `AllWires` and `AnyWires`.
  [(#614)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/614)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* A new `Wires` class was introduced for the internal 
  bookkeeping of wire indices.
  [(#615)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/615)

* Improvements to the speed/performance of the `default.qubit` device.
  [(#567)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/567)
  [(#559)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/559)

* Added the `"backprop"` and `"device"` differentiation methods to the `qnode`
  decorator.
  [(#552)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/552)

  - `"backprop"`: Use classical backpropagation. Default on simulator
    devices that are classically end-to-end differentiable.
    The returned QNode can only be used with the same machine learning
    framework (e.g., ``default.tensor.tf`` simulator with the ``tensorflow`` interface).

  - `"device"`: Queries the device directly for the gradient.

  Using the `"backprop"` differentiation method with the `default.tensor.tf`
  device, the created QNode is a 'white-box', and is tightly integrated with
  the overall TensorFlow computation:

  ```python
  >>> dev = qml.device("default.tensor.tf", wires=1)
  >>> @qml.qnode(dev, interface="tf", diff_method="backprop")
  >>> def circuit(x):
  ...     qml.RX(x[1], wires=0)
  ...     qml.Rot(x[0], x[1], x[2], wires=0)
  ...     return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  >>> vars = tf.Variable([0.2, 0.5, 0.1])
  >>> with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  ...     res = circuit(vars)
  >>> tape.gradient(res, vars)
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(3,), dtype=float32, numpy=array([-2.2526717e-01, -1.0086454e+00,  1.3877788e-17], dtype=float32)>
  ```

* The circuit drawer now displays inverted operations, as well as wires
  where probabilities are returned from the device:
  [(#540)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/540)

  ```python
  >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
  ... def circuit(theta):
  ...     qml.RX(theta, wires=0)
  ...     qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
  ...     qml.S(wires=1).inv()
  ...     return qml.probs(wires=[0, 1])
  >>> circuit(0.2)
  array([0.99003329, 0.        , 0.        , 0.00996671])
  >>> print(circuit.draw())
  0: ──RX(0.2)──╭C───────╭┤ Probs
  1: ───────────╰X──S⁻¹──╰┤ Probs
  ```

* You can now evaluate the metric tensor of a VQE Hamiltonian via the new
  `VQECost.metric_tensor` method. This allows `VQECost` objects to be directly
  optimized by the quantum natural gradient optimizer (`qml.QNGOptimizer`).
  [(#618)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/618)

* The input check functions in `pennylane.templates.utils` are now public
  and visible in the API documentation.
  [(#566)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/566)

* Added keyword arguments for step size and order to the `qnode` decorator, as well as
  the `QNode` and `JacobianQNode` classes. This enables the user to set the step size
  and order when using finite difference methods. These options are also exposed when
  creating QNode collections.
  [(#530)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/530)
  [(#585)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/585)
  [(#587)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/587)

* The decomposition for the `CRY` gate now uses the simpler form `RY @ CNOT @ RY @ CNOT`
  [(#547)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/547)

* The underlying queuing system was refactored, removing the `qml._current_context`
  property that held the currently active `QNode` or `OperationRecorder`. Now, all
  objects that expose a queue for operations inherit from `QueuingContext` and
  register their queue globally.
  [(#548)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/548)

* The PennyLane repository has a new benchmarking tool which supports the comparison of different git revisions.
  [(#568)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/568)
  [(#560)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/560)

  containing specific guides.
  [(#596)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/596)

* Extended the developer's guide by a section explaining how to add new templates.
  [(#564)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/564)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* `tf.GradientTape().jacobian()` can now be evaluated on QNodes using the TensorFlow interface.
  [(#626)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/626)

* `RandomLayers()` is now compatible with the qiskit devices.
  [(#597)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/597)

* `DefaultQubit.probability()` now returns the correct probability when called with
  `device.analytic=False`.
  [(#563)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/563)

* Fixed a bug in the `StronglyEntanglingLayers` template, allowing it to
  work correctly when applied to a single wire.
  [(544)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/544)

* Fixed a bug when inverting operations with decompositions; operations marked as inverted
  are now correctly inverted when the fallback decomposition is called.
  [(#543)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/543)

* The `QNode.print_applied()` method now correctly displays wires where
  `qml.prob()` is being returned.

  - `qml.Hamiltonian`: a lightweight class for representing qubit Hamiltonians
  - `qml.VQECost`: a class for quickly constructing a differentiable cost function
    given a circuit ansatz, Hamiltonian, and one or more devices

    ```python
    >>> H = qml.vqe.Hamiltonian(coeffs, obs)
    >>> cost = qml.VQECost(ansatz, hamiltonian, dev, interface="torch")
    >>> params = torch.rand([4, 3])
    >>> cost(params)
    tensor(0.0245, dtype=torch.float64)
    ```

* Added a circuit drawing feature that provides a text-based representation
  of a QNode instance. It can be invoked via `qnode.draw()`. The user can specify
  to display variable names instead of variable values and choose either an ASCII
  or Unicode charset.
  [(#446)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/446)

  Consider the following circuit as an example:
  ```python3
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def qfunc(a, w):
      qml.Hadamard(0)
      qml.CRX(a, wires=[0, 1])
      qml.Rot(w[0], w[1], w[2], wires=[1])
      qml.CRX(-a, wires=[0, 1])

      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1))
  ```

  We can draw the circuit after it has been executed:

  ```python
  >>> result = qfunc(2.3, [1.2, 3.2, 0.7])
  >>> print(qfunc.draw())
   0: ──H──╭C────────────────────────────╭C─────────╭┤ ⟨Z ⊗ Z⟩
   1: ─────╰RX(2.3)──Rot(1.2, 3.2, 0.7)──╰RX(-2.3)──╰┤ ⟨Z ⊗ Z⟩
  >>> print(qfunc.draw(charset="ascii"))
   0: --H--+C----------------------------+C---------+| <Z @ Z>
   1: -----+RX(2.3)--Rot(1.2, 3.2, 0.7)--+RX(-2.3)--+| <Z @ Z>
  >>> print(qfunc.draw(show_variable_names=True))
   0: ──H──╭C─────────────────────────────╭C─────────╭┤ ⟨Z ⊗ Z⟩
   1: ─────╰RX(a)──Rot(w[0], w[1], w[2])──╰RX(-1*a)──╰┤ ⟨Z ⊗ Z⟩
  ```

* Added `QAOAEmbedding` and its parameter initialization
  as a new trainable template.
  [(#442)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/442)

  <img src="https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/qaoa_layers.png"
  width=70%></img>

* Added the `qml.probs()` measurement function, allowing QNodes
  to differentiate variational circuit probabilities
  on simulators and hardware.
  [(#432)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/432)

  ```python
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
      qml.RY(x, wires=0)
      qml.RX(x, wires=1)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      return qml.probs(wires=[0])
  ```
  Executing this circuit gives the marginal probability of wire 1:
  ```python
  >>> circuit(0.2)
  [0.40066533 0.59933467]
  ```
  QNodes that return probabilities fully support autodifferentiation.

* Added the convenience load functions `qml.from_pyquil`, `qml.from_quil` and
  `qml.from_quil_file` that convert pyQuil objects and Quil code to PennyLane
  templates. This feature requires version 0.8 or above of the PennyLane-Forest
  plugin.
  [(#459)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/459)

* Added a `qml.inv` method that inverts templates and sequences of Operations.
  Added a `@qml.template` decorator that makes templates return the queued Operations.
  [(#462)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/462)

  For example, using this function to invert a template inside a QNode:

  ```python3
      @qml.template
      def ansatz(weights, wires):
          for idx, wire in enumerate(wires):
              qml.RX(weights[idx], wires=[wire])

          for idx in range(len(wires) - 1):
              qml.CNOT(wires=[wires[idx], wires[idx + 1]])

      dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=2)

      @qml.qnode(dev)
      def circuit(weights):
          qml.inv(ansatz(weights, wires=[0, 1]))
          return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1))
    ```

* Added the `QNodeCollection` container class, that allows independent
  QNodes to be stored and evaluated simultaneously. Experimental support
  for asynchronous evaluation of contained QNodes is provided with the
  `parallel=True` keyword argument.
  [(#466)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/466)

* Added a high level `qml.map` function, that maps a quantum
  circuit template over a list of observables or devices, returning
  a `QNodeCollection`.
  [(#466)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/466)

  For example:

  ```python3
  >>> def my_template(params, wires, **kwargs):
  >>>    qml.RX(params[0], wires=wires[0])
  >>>    qml.RX(params[1], wires=wires[1])
  >>>    qml.CNOT(wires=wires)

  >>> obs_list = [qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1), qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliX(1)]
  >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)
  >>> qnodes = qml.map(my_template, obs_list, dev, measure="expval")
  >>> qnodes([0.54, 0.12])
  array([-0.06154835  0.99280864])
  ```

* Added high level `qml.sum`, `qml.dot`, `qml.apply` functions
  that act on QNode collections.
  [(#466)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/466)

  `qml.apply` allows vectorized functions to act over the entire QNode
  collection:
  ```python
  >>> qnodes = qml.map(my_template, obs_list, dev, measure="expval")
  >>> cost = qml.apply(np.sin, qnodes)
  >>> cost([0.54, 0.12])
  array([-0.0615095  0.83756375])
  ```

  `qml.sum` and `qml.dot` take the sum of a QNode collection, and a
  dot product of tensors/arrays/QNode collections, respectively.

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* Deprecated the old-style `QNode` such that only the new-style `QNode` and its syntax can be used,
  moved all related files from the `pennylane/beta` folder to `pennylane`.
  [(#440)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/440)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Added the `Tensor.prune()` method and the `Tensor.non_identity_obs` property for extracting
  non-identity instances from the observables making up a `Tensor` instance.
  [(#498)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/498)

* Renamed the `expt.tensornet` and `expt.tensornet.tf` devices to `default.tensor` and
  `default.tensor.tf`.
  [(#495)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/495)

* Added a serialization method to the `CircuitGraph` class that is used to create a unique
  hash for each quantum circuit graph.
  [(#470)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/470)

* Added the `Observable.eigvals` method to return the eigenvalues of observables.
  [(#449)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/449)

* Added the `Observable.diagonalizing_gates` method to return the gates
  that diagonalize an observable in the computational basis.
  [(#454)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/454)

* Added the `Operator.matrix` method to return the matrix representation
  of an operator in the computational basis.
  [(#454)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/454)

* Added a `QubitDevice` class which implements common functionalities of plugin devices such that
  plugin devices can rely on these implementations. The new `QubitDevice` also includes
  a new `execute` method, which allows for more convenient plugin design. In addition, `QubitDevice`
  also unifies the way samples are generated on qubit-based devices.
  [(#452)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/452)
  [(#473)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/473)

* Improved documentation of `AmplitudeEmbedding` and `BasisEmbedding` templates.
  [(#441)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/441)
  [(#439)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/439)

* Codeblocks in the documentation now have a 'copy' button for easily
  copying examples.
  [(#437)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/437)

<h3>Documentation</h3>

* Update the developers plugin guide to use QubitDevice.
  [(#483)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/483)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fixed a bug in `CVQNode._pd_analytic`, where non-descendant observables were not
  Heisenberg-transformed before evaluating the partial derivatives when using the
  order-2 parameter-shift method, resulting in an erroneous Jacobian for some circuits.
  [(#433)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/433)

  [(#409)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/409)
  [(#413)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/413)

* Added support for applying the inverse of an `Operation` within a circuit.
  [(#377)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/377)

* Operations can now specify a decomposition that is used when the desired operation
  is not supported on the target device.
  [(#396)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/396)

* The ability to load circuits from external frameworks as templates
  has been added via the new `qml.load()` function. This feature
  requires plugin support --- this initial release provides support
  for Qiskit circuits and QASM files when `pennylane-qiskit` is installed,
  via the functions `qml.from_qiskit` and `qml.from_qasm`.
  [(#418)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/418)

* An experimental tensor network device has been added
  [(#416)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/416)

  [(#419)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/419)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* The `pad` parameter in `AmplitudeEmbedding()` is now either `None` (no automatic padding), or a
  number that is used as the padding constant.
  [(#419)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/419)

* Initialization functions now return a single array of weights per function. Utilities for multi-weight templates
  `Interferometer()` and `CVNeuralNetLayers()` are provided.
  [(#412)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/412)

* The single layer templates `RandomLayer()`, `CVNeuralNetLayer()` and `StronglyEntanglingLayer()`
  have been turned into private functions `_random_layer()`, `_cv_neural_net_layer()` and
  `_strongly_entangling_layer()`. Recommended use is now via the corresponding `Layers()` templates.
  [(#413)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/413)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Added extensive input checks in templates.
  [(#419)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/419)

* Templates integration tests are rewritten - now cover keyword/positional argument passing,
  interfaces and combinations of templates.
  [(#409)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/409)
  [(#419)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/419)

* State vector preparation operations in the `default.qubit` plugin can now be
  applied to subsets of wires, and are restricted to being the first operation
  in a circuit.
  [(#346)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/346)

* The `QNode` class is split into a hierarchy of simpler classes.
  [(#354)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/354)
  [(#398)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/398)
  [(#415)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/415)
  [(#417)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/417)
  [(#425)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/425)

* Added the gates U1, U2 and U3 parametrizing arbitrary unitaries on 1, 2 and 3
  qubits and the Toffoli gate to the set of qubit operations.
  [(#396)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/396)

* Changes have been made to accomodate the movement of the main function
  in `pytest._internal` to `pytest._internal.main` in pip 19.3.
  [(#404)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/404)

* Added the templates `BasisStatePreparation` and `MottonenStatePreparation` that use
  gates to prepare a basis state and an arbitrary state respectively.
  [(#336)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/336)

* Added decompositions for `BasisState` and `QubitStateVector` based on state
  preparation templates.
  [(#414)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/414)

* Replaces the pseudo-inverse in the quantum natural gradient optimizer
  (which can be numerically unstable) with `np.linalg.solve`.
  [(#428)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/428)

  `Observable` class and the `Operation` class.
  [(#355)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/355)

* Removed deprecated `@abstractproperty` decorators
  in `_device.py`.

# Release 0.6.0

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* The devices `default.qubit` and `default.gaussian` have a new initialization parameter
  `analytic` that indicates if expectation values and variances should be calculated
  analytically and not be estimated from data.
  [(#317)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/317)

* Added C-SWAP gate to the set of qubit operations
  [(#330)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/330)

  [(#343)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/343)

* Tensor observables are now supported within the `expval`,
  `var`, and `sample` functions, by using the `@` operator.
  [(#267)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/267)


<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* The argument `n` specifying the number of samples in the method `Device.sample` was removed.
  Instead, the method will always return `Device.shots` many samples.
  [(#317)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/317)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* The number of shots / random samples used to estimate expectation values and variances, `Device.shots`,
  can now be changed after device creation.
  [(#317)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/317)

* Unified import shortcuts to be under qml in qnode.py
  and test_operation.py
  [(#329)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/329)

* The quantum natural gradient now uses `scipy.linalg.pinvh` which is more efficient for symmetric matrices
  than the previously used `scipy.linalg.pinv`.
  [(#331)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/331)

* The deprecated `qml.expval.Observable` syntax has been removed.
  [(#267)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/267)

* Remainder of the unittest-style tests were ported to pytest.
  [(#310)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/310)

* The `do_queue` argument for operations now only takes effect
  within QNodes. Outside of QNodes, operations can now be instantiated
  without needing to specify `do_queue`.
  [(#359)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/359)

# Release 0.5.0

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Adds a new optimizer, `qml.QNGOptimizer`, which optimizes QNodes using
  quantum natural gradient descent. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02108
  for more details.
  [(#295)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/295)
  [(#311)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/311)

* Adds a new QNode method, `QNode.metric_tensor()`,
  which returns the block-diagonal approximation to the Fubini-Study
  metric tensor evaluated on the attached device.
  [(#295)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/295)

* Sampling support: QNodes can now return a specified number of samples
  from a given observable via the top-level `pennylane.sample()` function.
  To support this on plugin devices, there is a new `Device.sample` method.

  Calculating gradients of QNodes that involve sampling is not possible.
  [(#256)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/256)

* `default.qubit` has been updated to provide support for sampling.
  [(#256)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/256)

* Added controlled rotation gates to PennyLane operations and `default.qubit` plugin.
  [(#251)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/251)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* The method `Device.supported` was removed, and replaced with the methods
  `Device.supports_observable` and `Device.supports_operation`.
  Both methods can be called with string arguments (`dev.supports_observable('PauliX')`) and
  class arguments (`dev.supports_observable(qml.PauliX)`).
  [(#276)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/276)

* The following CV observables were renamed to comply with the new Operation/Observable
  scheme: `MeanPhoton` to `NumberOperator`, `Homodyne` to `QuadOperator` and `NumberState` to `FockStateProjector`.
  [(#254)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/254)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* The `AmplitudeEmbedding` function now provides options to normalize and
  pad features to ensure a valid state vector is prepared.
  [(#275)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/275)

* Operations can now optionally specify generators, either as existing PennyLane
  operations, or by providing a NumPy array.
  [(#295)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/295)
  [(#313)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/313)

* Adds a `Device.parameters` property, so that devices can view a dictionary mapping free
  parameters to operation parameters. This will allow plugin devices to take advantage
  of parametric compilation.
  [(#283)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/283)

* Introduces two enumerations: `Any` and `All`, representing any number of wires
  and all wires in the system respectively. They can be imported from
  `pennylane.operation`, and can be used when defining the `Operation.num_wires`
  class attribute of operations.
  [(#277)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/277)

  As part of this change:

  - `All` is equivalent to the integer 0, for backwards compatibility with the
    existing test suite

  - `Any` is equivalent to the integer -1 to allow numeric comparison
    operators to continue working

  - An additional validation is now added to the `Operation` class,
    which will alert the user that an operation with `num_wires = All`
    is being incorrectly.

* The one-qubit rotations in `pennylane.plugins.default_qubit` no longer depend on Scipy's `expm`. Instead
  they are calculated with Euler's formula.
  [(#292)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/292)

* Creates an `ObservableReturnTypes` enumeration class containing `Sample`,
  `Variance` and `Expectation`. These new values can be assigned to the `return_type`
  attribute of an `Observable`.
  [(#290)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/290)

* Changed the signature of the `RandomLayer` and `RandomLayers` templates to have a fixed seed by default.
  [(#258)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/258)

* `setup.py` has been cleaned up, removing the non-working shebang,
  and removing unused imports.
  [(#262)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/262)

<h3>Documentation</h3>

* A documentation refactor to simplify the tutorials and
  include Sphinx-Gallery.
  [(#291)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/291)

  - Examples and tutorials previously split across the `examples/`
    and `doc/tutorials/` directories, in a mixture of ReST and Jupyter notebooks,
    have been rewritten as Python scripts with ReST comments in a single location,
    the `examples/` folder.

  - Sphinx-Gallery is used to automatically build and run the tutorials.
    Rendered output is displayed in the Sphinx documentation.

  - Links are provided at the top of every tutorial page for downloading the
    tutorial as an executable python script, downloading the tutorial
    as a Jupyter notebook, or viewing the notebook on GitHub.

  - The tutorials table of contents have been moved to a single quick start page.

* Fixed a typo in `QubitStateVector`.

# Release 0.4.0

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* `pennylane.expval()` is now a top-level *function*, and is no longer
  a package of classes. For now, the existing `pennylane.expval.Observable`
  interface continues to work, but will raise a deprecation warning.
  [(#232)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/232)

* Variance support: QNodes can now return the variance of observables,
  via the top-level `pennylane.var()` function. To support this on
  plugin devices, there is a new `Device.var` method.

  The following observables support analytic gradients of variances:

  - All qubit observables (requiring 3 circuit evaluations for involutory
    observables such as `Identity`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`; and 5 circuit evals for
    non-involutary observables, currently only `qml.Hermitian`)

  - First-order CV observables (requiring 5 circuit evaluations)

  Second-order CV observables support numerical variance gradients.

* `pennylane.about()` function added, providing details
  on current PennyLane version, installed plugins, Python,
  platform, and NumPy versions [(#186)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/186)

* Removed the logic that allowed `wires` to be passed as a positional
  argument in quantum operations. This allows us to raise more useful
  error messages for the user if incorrect syntax is used.
  [(#188)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/188)

* Adds support for multi-qubit expectation values of the `pennylane.Hermitian()`
  observable [(#192)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/192)

* Adds support for multi-qubit expectation values in `default.qubit`.
  [(#202)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/202)

* Organize templates into submodules [(#195)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/195).
  This included the following improvements:

  - Distinguish embedding templates from layer templates.

  - New random initialization functions supporting the templates available
    in the new submodule `pennylane.init`.

  - Added a random circuit template (`RandomLayers()`), in which rotations and 2-qubit gates are randomly
    distributed over the wires

  - Add various embedding strategies

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* The `Device` methods `expectations`, `pre_expval`, and `post_expval` have been
  renamed to `observables`, `pre_measure`, and `post_measure` respectively.
  [(#232)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/232)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* `default.qubit` plugin now uses `np.tensordot` when applying quantum operations
  and evaluating expectations, resulting in significant speedup
  [(#239)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/239),
  [(#241)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/241)

* PennyLane now allows division of quantum operation parameters by a constant
  [(#179)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/179)

* Portions of the test suite are in the process of being ported to pytest.
  Note: this is still a work in progress.

  Ported tests include:

  - `test_ops.py`
  - `test_about.py`
  - `test_classical_gradients.py`
  - `test_observables.py`
  - `test_measure.py`
  - `test_init.py`
  - `test_templates*.py`
  - `test_ops.py`
  - `test_variable.py`
  - `test_qnode.py` (partial)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fixed a bug in `Device.supported`, which would incorrectly
  mark an operation as supported if it shared a name with an
  observable [(#203)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/203)

* Fixed a bug in `Operation.wires`, by explicitly casting the
  type of each wire to an integer [(#206)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/206)

* Removed code in PennyLane which configured the logger,
  as this would clash with users' configurations
  [(#208)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/208)

* Fixed a bug in `default.qubit`, in which `QubitStateVector` operations
  were accidentally being cast to `np.float` instead of `np.complex`.

# Release 0.3.1

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fixed a bug where the interfaces submodule was not correctly being packaged via setup.py

# Release 0.3.0

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* PennyLane now includes a new `interfaces` submodule, which enables QNode integration with additional machine learning libraries.
* Adds support for an experimental PyTorch interface for QNodes
* Adds support for an experimental TensorFlow eager execution interface for QNodes
* Adds a PyTorch+GPU+QPU tutorial to the documentation
* Documentation now includes links and tutorials including the new [PennyLane-Forest](https://github.com/rigetti/pennylane-forest) plugin.

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Printing a QNode object, via `print(qnode)` or in an interactive terminal, now displays more useful information regarding the QNode,
  including the device it runs on, the number of wires, it's interface, and the quantum function it uses:

  ```python
  >>> print(qnode)
  <QNode: device='default.qubit', func=circuit, wires=2, interface=PyTorch>
  ```

# Release 0.2.0

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Added the `Identity` expectation value for both CV and qubit models [(#135)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/135)
* Added the `templates.py` submodule, containing some commonly used QML models to be used as ansatz in QNodes [(#133)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/133)
* Added the `qml.Interferometer` CV operation [(#152)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/152)
* Wires are now supported as free QNode parameters [(#151)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/151)
* Added ability to update stepsizes of the optimizers [(#159)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/159)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Removed use of hardcoded values in the optimizers, made them parameters (see [#131](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/131) and [#132](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/132))
* Created the new `PlaceholderExpectation`, to be used when both CV and qubit expval modules contain expectations with the same name
* Provide the plugins a way to view the operation queue _before_ applying operations. This allows for on-the-fly modifications of
  the queue, allowing hardware-based plugins to support the full range of qubit expectation values. [(#143)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/143)
* QNode return values now support _any_ form of sequence, such as lists, sets, etc. [(#144)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/144)
* CV analytic gradient calculation is now more robust, allowing for operations which may not themselves be differentiated, but have a
  well defined `_heisenberg_rep` method, and so may succeed operations that are analytically differentiable [(#152)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/152)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fixed a bug where the variational classifier example was not batching when learning parity (see [#128](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/128) and [#129](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/129))
* Fixed an inconsistency where some initial state operations were documented as accepting complex parameters - all operations
  now accept real values [(#146)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/146)
