# Release 0.8.0-dev

### New features since last release

* Added a quantum chemistry package, `pennylane.qchem`, which supports
  integration with OpenFermion, Psi4, PySCF, and OpenBabel.
  [#453](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/453)

  Features include:

  - Generate the qubit Hamiltonians directly starting with the atomic structure of the molecule.
  - Calculate the mean-field (Hartree-Fock) electronic structure of molecules.
  - Allow to define an active space based on the number of active electrons and active orbitals.
  - Perform the fermionic-to-qubit transformation of the electronic Hamiltonian by
    using different functions implemented in OpenFermion.
  - Convert OpenFermion's QubitOperator to Pennylane's Hamiltonian class.

* Added a `QubitDevice` class which implements common functionalities of plugin devices such that
  plugin devices can rely on these implementations.
  [#452](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/452)

* Added `QAOAEmbedding` and its parameter initialization
  as a new trainable template.
  [#442](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/442)

* Added `qml.prob()` measurement function, allowing QNodes
  to differentiate variational circuit probabilities
  on simulators and hardware.
  [#432](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/432)

* Added the `QNodeCollection` container class, that allows independent
  QNodes to be stored and evaluated simultaneously.
  [#466](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/466)

* Added high level `qml.sum`, `qml.dot`, `qml.apply` functions
  that act on QNode collections.
  [#466](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/466)

* Added a high level `qml.map` function, that maps a quantum
  circuit template over a list of observables or devices, returning
  a `QNodeCollection`.
  [#466](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/466)

### Breaking changes

* Deprecated the old `QNode` such that only the new `QNode` and its syntax can be used,
  moved all related files from the `pennylane/beta` folder to `pennylane`.
  [#440](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/440)

### Improvements

* Added the ``Observable.eigvals`` method to return the eigenvalues of observables.
  [#449](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/449)

* Added the ``Observable.diagonalizing_gates`` method to return the gates
  that diagonalize an observable in the computational basis.
  [#454](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/454)

* Added the ``Operator.matrix`` method to return the matrix representation
  of an operator in the computational basis.
  [#454](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/454)

### Documentation

* Improved documentation of `AmplitudeEmbedding` and `BasisEmbedding` templates.
  [#441](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/441)
  [#439](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/439)

* Codeblocks in the documentation now have a 'copy' button for easily
  copying examples.
  [#437](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/437)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug in `CVQNode._pd_analytic`, where non-descendant observables were not
  Heisenberg-transformed before evaluating the partial derivatives when using the
  order-2 parameter-shift method, resulting in an erroneous Jacobian for some circuits.
  [#433](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/433)

# Release 0.7.0

### New features since last release

* Custom padding constant in `AmplitudeEmbedding` is supported (see 'Breaking changes'.)
  [#419](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/419)

* `StronglyEntanglingLayer` and `RandomLayer` now work with a single wire.
   [#409](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/409)
   [#413](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/413)

* Added support for applying the inverse of an `Operation` within a circuit.
  [#377](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/377)

* Added an `OperationRecorder()` context manager, that allows templates
  and quantum functions to be executed while recording events. The
  recorder can be used with and without QNodes as a debugging utility.
  [#388](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/388)

* Operations can now specify a decomposition that is used when the desired operation
  is not supported on the target device.
  [#396](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/396)

* The ability to load circuits from external frameworks as templates
  has been added via the new `qml.load()` function. This feature
  requires plugin support --- this initial release provides support
  for Qiskit circuits and QASM files when `pennylane-qiskit` is installed,
  via the functions `qml.from_qiskit` and `qml.from_qasm`.
  [#418](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/418)

* An experimental tensor network device has been added
  [#416](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/416)
  [#395](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/395)
  [#394](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/394)
  [#380](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/380)

* An experimental tensor network device which uses TensorFlow for
  backpropagation has been added
  [#427](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/427)

* Custom padding constant in `AmplitudeEmbedding` is supported (see 'Breaking changes'.)
  [#419](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/419)

### Breaking changes

* The ``pad`` parameter in `AmplitudeEmbedding()`` is now either ``None`` (no automatic padding), or a
  number that is used as the padding constant.
  [#419](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/419)

* Initialization functions now return a single array of weights per function. Utilities for multi-weight templates
  `Interferometer()` and `CVNeuralNetLayers()` are provided.
  [#412](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/412)

* The single layer templates `RandomLayer()`, `CVNeuralNetLayer()` and `StronglyEntanglingLayer()`
  have been turned into private functions `_random_layer()`, `_cv_neural_net_layer()` and
  `_strongly_entangling_layer()`. Recommended use is now via the corresponding `Layers()` templates.
  [#413](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/413)

### Improvements

* Added extensive input checks in templates.
  [#419](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/419)

* Templates integration tests are rewritten - now cover keyword/positional argument passing,
  interfaces and combinations of templates.
  [#409](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/409)
  [#419](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/419)

* State vector preparation operations in the `default.qubit` plugin can now be
  applied to subsets of wires, and are restricted to being the first operation
  in a circuit.
  [#346](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/346)

* The `QNode` class is split into a hierarchy of simpler classes.
  [#354](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/354)
  [#398](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/398)
  [#415](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/415)
  [#417](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/417)
  [#425](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/425)

* Added the gates U1, U2 and U3 parametrizing arbitrary unitaries on 1, 2 and 3
  qubits and the Toffoli gate to the set of qubit operations.
  [#396](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/396)

* Changes have been made to accomodate the movement of the main function
  in `pytest._internal` to `pytest._internal.main` in pip 19.3.
  [#404](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/404)

* Added the templates `BasisStatePreparation` and `MottonenStatePreparation` that use
  gates to prepare a basis state and an arbitrary state respectively.
  [#336](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/336)

* Added decompositions for `BasisState` and `QubitStateVector` based on state
  preparation templates.
  [#414](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/414)

* Replaces the pseudo-inverse in the quantum natural gradient optimizer
  (which can be numerically unstable) with `np.linalg.solve`.

  and observable queue to be printed as last constructed.
  [#378](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/378)

### Improvements

* A new `Operator` base class is introduced, which is inherited by both the
  `Observable` class and the `Operation` class.
  [#355](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/355)

* Removed deprecated `@abstractproperty` decorators
  in `_device.py`.

# Release 0.6.0

### New features since last release

* The devices `default.qubit` and `default.gaussian` have a new initialization parameter
  `analytic` that indicates if expectation values and variances should be calculated
  analytically and not be estimated from data.
  [#317](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/317)

* Added C-SWAP gate to the set of qubit operations
  [#330](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/330)

* The TensorFlow interface has been renamed from `"tfe"` to `"tf"`, and
  now supports TensorFlow 2.0.
  [#337](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/337)

* Added the S and T gates to the set of qubit operations.
  [#343](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/343)

* Tensor observables are now supported within the `expval`,
  `var`, and `sample` functions, by using the `@` operator.
  [#267](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/267)


### Breaking changes

* The argument `n` specifying the number of samples in the method `Device.sample` was removed.
  Instead, the method will always return `Device.shots` many samples.
  [#317](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/317)

### Improvements

* The number of shots / random samples used to estimate expectation values and variances, `Device.shots`,
  can now be changed after device creation.
  [#317](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/317)

* Unified import shortcuts to be under qml in qnode.py
  and test_operation.py
  [#329](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/329)

* The quantum natural gradient now uses `scipy.linalg.pinvh` which is more efficient for symmetric matrices
  than the previously used `scipy.linalg.pinv`.
  [#331](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/331)

* The deprecated `qml.expval.Observable` syntax has been removed.
  [#267](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/267)

* Remainder of the unittest-style tests were ported to pytest.
  [#310](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/310)

* The `do_queue` argument for operations now only takes effect
  within QNodes. Outside of QNodes, operations can now be instantiated
  without needing to specify `do_queue`.
  [#359](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/359)

### Documentation

* The docs are rewritten and restructured to contain a code introduction section as well as an API section.
  [#314](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/275)

# Release 0.5.0

### New features since last release

* Adds a new optimizer, `qml.QNGOptimizer`, which optimizes QNodes using
  quantum natural gradient descent. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02108
  for more details.
  [#295](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/295)
  [#311](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/311)

* Adds a new QNode method, `QNode.metric_tensor()`,
  which returns the block-diagonal approximation to the Fubini-Study
  metric tensor evaluated on the attached device.
  [#295](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/295)

* Sampling support: QNodes can now return a specified number of samples
  from a given observable via the top-level `pennylane.sample()` function.
  To support this on plugin devices, there is a new `Device.sample` method.

  Calculating gradients of QNodes that involve sampling is not possible.
  [#256](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/256)

* `default.qubit` has been updated to provide support for sampling.
  [#256](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/256)

* Added controlled rotation gates to PennyLane operations and `default.qubit` plugin.
  [#251](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/251)

### Breaking changes

* The method `Device.supported` was removed, and replaced with the methods
  `Device.supports_observable` and `Device.supports_operation`.
  Both methods can be called with string arguments (`dev.supports_observable('PauliX')`) and
  class arguments (`dev.supports_observable(qml.PauliX)`).
  [#276](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/276)

* The following CV observables were renamed to comply with the new Operation/Observable
  scheme: `MeanPhoton` to `NumberOperator`, `Homodyne` to `QuadOperator` and `NumberState` to `FockStateProjector`.
  [#243](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/254)

### Improvements

* The `AmplitudeEmbedding` function now provides options to normalize and
  pad features to ensure a valid state vector is prepared.
  [#275](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/275)

* Operations can now optionally specify generators, either as existing PennyLane
  operations, or by providing a NumPy array.
  [#295](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/295)
  [#313](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/313)

* Adds a `Device.parameters` property, so that devices can view a dictionary mapping free
  parameters to operation parameters. This will allow plugin devices to take advantage
  of parametric compilation.
  [#283](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/283)

* Introduces two enumerations: `Any` and `All`, representing any number of wires
  and all wires in the system respectively. They can be imported from
  `pennylane.operation`, and can be used when defining the `Operation.num_wires`
  class attribute of operations.
  [#277](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/277)

  As part of this change:

  - `All` is equivalent to the integer 0, for backwards compatibility with the
    existing test suite

  - `Any` is equivalent to the integer -1 to allow numeric comparison
    operators to continue working

  - An additional validation is now added to the `Operation` class,
    which will alert the user that an operation with `num_wires = All`
    is being incorrectly.

* The one-qubit rotations in `pennylane.plugins.default_qubit` no longer depend on Scipy's `expm`. Instead
  they are calculated with Euler's formula.
  [#292](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/292)

* Creates an `ObservableReturnTypes` enumeration class containing `Sample`,
  `Variance` and `Expectation`. These new values can be assigned to the `return_type`
  attribute of an `Observable`.
  [#290](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/290)

* Changed the signature of the `RandomLayer` and `RandomLayers` templates to have a fixed seed by default.
  [#258](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/258)

* `setup.py` has been cleaned up, removing the non-working shebang,
  and removing unused imports.
  [#262](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/262)

### Documentation

* A documentation refactor to simplify the tutorials and
  include Sphinx-Gallery.
  [#291](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/291)

  - Examples and tutorials previously split across the `examples/`
    and `doc/tutorials/` directories, in a mixture of ReST and Jupyter notebooks,
    have been rewritten as Python scripts with ReST comments in a single location,
    the `examples/` folder.

  - Sphinx-Gallery is used to automatically build and run the tutorials.
    Rendered output is displayed in the Sphinx documentation.

  - Links are provided at the top of every tutorial page for downloading the
    tutorial as an executable python script, downloading the tutorial
    as a Jupyter notebook, or viewing the notebook on GitHub.

  - The tutorials table of contents have been moved to a single quick start page.

* Fixed a typo in `QubitStateVector`.
  [#295](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/296)

* Fixed a typo in the `default_gaussian.gaussian_state` function.
  [#293](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/293)

* Fixed a typo in the gradient recipe within the `RX`, `RY`, `RZ`
  operation docstrings.
  [#248](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/248)

* Fixed a broken link in the tutorial documentation, as a
  result of the `qml.expval.Observable` deprecation.
  [#246](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/246)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug where a `PolyXP` observable would fail if applied to subsets
  of wires on `default.gaussian`.
  [#277](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/277)

# Release 0.4.0

### New features since last release

* `pennylane.expval()` is now a top-level *function*, and is no longer
  a package of classes. For now, the existing `pennylane.expval.Observable`
  interface continues to work, but will raise a deprecation warning.
  [#232](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/232)

* Variance support: QNodes can now return the variance of observables,
  via the top-level `pennylane.var()` function. To support this on
  plugin devices, there is a new `Device.var` method.

  The following observables support analytic gradients of variances:

  - All qubit observables (requiring 3 circuit evaluations for involutory
    observables such as `Identity`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`; and 5 circuit evals for
    non-involutary observables, currently only `qml.Hermitian`)

  - First-order CV observables (requiring 5 circuit evaluations)

  Second-order CV observables support numerical variance gradients.

* `pennylane.about()` function added, providing details
  on current PennyLane version, installed plugins, Python,
  platform, and NumPy versions [#186](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/186)

* Removed the logic that allowed `wires` to be passed as a positional
  argument in quantum operations. This allows us to raise more useful
  error messages for the user if incorrect syntax is used.
  [#188](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/188)

* Adds support for multi-qubit expectation values of the `pennylane.Hermitian()`
  observable [#192](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/192)

* Adds support for multi-qubit expectation values in `default.qubit`.
  [#202](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/202)

* Organize templates into submodules [#195](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/195).
  This included the following improvements:

  - Distinguish embedding templates from layer templates.

  - New random initialization functions supporting the templates available
    in the new submodule `pennylane.init`.

  - Added a random circuit template (`RandomLayers()`), in which rotations and 2-qubit gates are randomly
    distributed over the wires

  - Add various embedding strategies

### Breaking changes

* The `Device` methods `expectations`, `pre_expval`, and `post_expval` have been
  renamed to `observables`, `pre_measure`, and `post_measure` respectively.
  [#232](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/232)

### Improvements

* `default.qubit` plugin now uses `np.tensordot` when applying quantum operations
  and evaluating expectations, resulting in significant speedup
  [#239](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/239),
  [#241](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/241)

* PennyLane now allows division of quantum operation parameters by a constant
  [#179](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/179)

* Portions of the test suite are in the process of being ported to pytest.
  Note: this is still a work in progress.

  Ported tests include:

  - `test_ops.py`
  - `test_about.py`
  - `test_classical_gradients.py`
  - `test_observables.py`
  - `test_measure.py`
  - `test_init.py`
  - `test_templates*.py`
  - `test_ops.py`
  - `test_variable.py`
  - `test_qnode.py` (partial)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug in `Device.supported`, which would incorrectly
  mark an operation as supported if it shared a name with an
  observable [#203](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/203)

* Fixed a bug in `Operation.wires`, by explicitly casting the
  type of each wire to an integer [#206](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/206)

* Removed code in PennyLane which configured the logger,
  as this would clash with users' configurations
  [#208](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/208)

* Fixed a bug in `default.qubit`, in which `QubitStateVector` operations
  were accidentally being cast to `np.float` instead of `np.complex`.
  [#211](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/211)

# Release 0.3.1

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug where the interfaces submodule was not correctly being packaged via setup.py

# Release 0.3.0

### New features since last release

* PennyLane now includes a new `interfaces` submodule, which enables QNode integration with additional machine learning libraries.

* Documentation now includes links and tutorials including the new [PennyLane-Forest](https://github.com/rigetti/pennylane-forest) plugin.

### Improvements

* Printing a QNode object, via `print(qnode)` or in an interactive terminal, now displays more useful information regarding the QNode,
  including the device it runs on, the number of wires, it's interface, and the quantum function it uses:

  ```python
  >>> print(qnode)
  <QNode: device='default.qubit', func=circuit, wires=2, interface=PyTorch>
  ```

# Release 0.2.0

### New features since last release

* Added the `Identity` expectation value for both CV and qubit models (#135)
* Added the `templates.py` submodule, containing some commonly used QML models to be used as ansatz in QNodes (#133)
* Added the `qml.Interferometer` CV operation (#152)
* Wires are now supported as free QNode parameters (#151)
* Added ability to update stepsizes of the optimizers (#159)

### Improvements

* Removed use of hardcoded values in the optimizers, made them parameters (see #131 and #132)
* Created the new `PlaceholderExpectation`, to be used when both CV and qubit expval modules contain expectations with the same name
* Provide the plugins a way to view the operation queue _before_ applying operations. This allows for on-the-fly modifications of
  the queue, allowing hardware-based plugins to support the full range of qubit expectation values. (#143)
* QNode return values now support _any_ form of sequence, such as lists, sets, etc. (#144)
* CV analytic gradient calculation is now more robust, allowing for operations which may not themselves be differentiated, but have a
  well defined `_heisenberg_rep` method, and so may succeed operations that are analytically differentiable (#152)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug where the variational classifier example was not batching when learning parity (see #128 and #129)
* Fixed an inconsistency where some initial state operations were documented as accepting complex parameters - all operations
  now accept real values (#146)
