def dot(x, y):
    r"""Lazily perform the dot product between arrays, tensors, and :class:`QNodeCollection`.

    Using this function, lazy dot products can be computed between two :class:`QNodeCollection`
    objects, or a :class:`QNodeCollection` object and an array/tensor object. In the latter
    case, only one-dimensional arrays/tensors are supported.

    Args:
        x (array or tensor or QNodeCollection): A QNode collection of independent QNodes,
            or an array/tensor object.
        y (array or tensor or QNodeCollection): A QNode collection of independent QNodes,
            or an array/tensor object.

    .. seealso:: :func:`~.apply`, :func:`~.sum`

    **Example:**

    We can create a QNodeCollection using :func:`~.map`:

    >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)
    >>> obs_list = [qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1), qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1)]
    >>> qnodes = qml.map(qml.templates.StronglyEntanglingLayers, obs_list, dev, interface="torch")

    The returned QNodeCollection contains 2 QNodes, as we mapped the :func:`~.StronglyEntanglingLayers`
    over a list of two observables:

    >>> len(qnodes)
    2

    For the cost function, we now perform the dot product between a vector of coefficients
    and the QNodeCollection:

    >>> coeffs = torch.tensor([0.32, -0.2], dtype=torch.double)
    >>> cost = qml.dot(coeffs, qnodes)

    .. note::

        The ``cost`` function is equivalent to computing :math:`\langle 0 | U(\theta)^\dagger H U(\theta) | 0\rangle`
        where

        * :math:`U(\theta)` is the unitary applied by the strongly entangling layers, and
        * :math:`H = 0.32 X\otimes Z - 0.2 Z \otimes Z`.

    This is a lazy dot product --- no QNode evaluation has yet occured. Evaluation
    only occurs when the returned function ``cost`` is evaluated:

    >>> x = qml.init.strong_ent_layers_normal(3, 2) # generate random parameters
    >>> cost(x)
    tensor(-0.2183, dtype=torch.float64, grad_fn=<DotBackward>)
