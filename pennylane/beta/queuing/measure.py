def probs(wires):
    r"""Probability of each computational basis state.

    This measurement function accepts no observables, and instead
    instructs the QNode to return a flat array containing the
    probabilities of each quantum state.

    Marginal probabilities may also be requested by restricting
    the wires to a subset of the full system; the size of the
    returned array will be ``[2**len(wires)]``.

    **Example:**

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit():

    >>> circuit()
    array([0.5, 0.5, 0. , 0. ])

    The returned array is in lexicographic order, so corresponds
    to a :math:`50\%` chance of measuring either :math:`|00\rangle`
    or :math:`|01\rangle`.

    Args:
        wires (Sequence[int] or int): the wire the operation acts on

def state(wires):
    r"""Quantum state in the computational basis.

    This function accepts no observables and instead instructs the QNode to return its state. The
    ``wires`` argument must specify all wires used in the device, as shown in the example below.
    This guarantees that the returned state is pure.

    **Example:**

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit():
            qml.Hadamard(wires=1)

    The returned array is in lexicographic order, so corresponds
    to a :math:`1/\sqrt{2}` amplitude in both :math:`|00\rangle`
    and :math:`|01\rangle`.

    .. note::

        Calculating the derivative of the ``state()`` return type is not supported when using the
        parameter-shift and finite-difference methods.
