class DefaultTensor(Device):
    """A PennyLane device to perform tensor network simulations of quantum circuits using
    `quimb <https://github.com/jcmgray/quimb/>`_.

    This device is designed to simulate large-scale quantum circuits using tensor networks. For small circuits, other devices like ``default.qubit`` may be more suitable.

    The backend uses the ``quimb`` library to perform the tensor network operations, and different methods can be used to simulate the quantum circuit.
    Currently, only the Matrix Product State (MPS) method is supported, based on ``quimb``'s ``CircuitMPS`` class.

    This device does not currently support finite shots or differentiation.
    The currently supported measurement types are expectation values and variances.

    Args:
        wires (int, Iterable[Number, str]): Number of wires present on the device, or iterable that
            contains unique labels for the wires as numbers (i.e., ``[-1, 0, 2]``) or strings
            (``['aux_wire', 'q1', 'q2']``).
        method (str): Supported method. Currently, only ``"mps"`` is supported.
        dtype (type): Data type for the tensor representation. Must be one of ``np.complex64`` or ``np.complex128``.
        **kwargs: keyword arguments for the device, passed to the ``quimb`` backend.

    Keyword Args:
        max_bond_dim (int): Maximum bond dimension for the MPS method.
            It corresponds to the maximum number of Schmidt coefficients retained at the end of the SVD algorithm when applying gates. Default is ``None``.
        cutoff (float): Truncation threshold for the Schmidt coefficients in the MPS method. Default is the machine limit for the given tensor data type,
            retrieved with the ``numpy.finfo`` function.
        contract (str): The contraction method for applying gates in the MPS method. It can be either ``auto-mps`` or ``nonlocal``.
            ``nonlocal`` turns each gate into a Matrix Product Operator (MPO) and applies it directly to the MPS,
            while ``auto-mps`` swaps nonlocal qubits in 2-qubit gates to be next to each other before applying the gate,
            then swaps them back. Default is ``auto-mps``.

    **Example:**

    The following code shows how to create a simple short-depth quantum circuit with 100 qubits using the ``default.tensor`` device.
    Depending on the machine, the execution time for this circuit is around 0.3 seconds:

    .. code-block:: python

        import pennylane as qml

        num_qubits = 100

        dev = qml.device("default.tensor", wires=num_qubits)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(num_qubits):
            for qubit in range(0, num_qubits - 1):
                qml.CZ(wires=[qubit, qubit + 1])
                qml.X(wires=[qubit])
                qml.Z(wires=[qubit + 1])
            return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))

    >>> circuit(num_qubits)
    tensor(-1., requires_grad=True)


    .. details::
            :title: Usage Details

            We can provide additional keyword arguments to the device to customize the simulation. These are passed to the ``quimb`` backend.

            In the following example, we consider a slightly more complex circuit. We use the ``default.tensor`` device with the MPS method,
            setting the maximum bond dimension to 100 and the cutoff to 1e-16. We set ``"auto-mps"`` as the contraction technique to apply gates.

            .. code-block:: python

                import pennylane as qml
                import numpy as np

                theta = 0.5
                phi = 0.1
                num_qubits = 50
                device_kwargs = {"max_bond_dim": 100, "cutoff": 1e-16, "contract": "auto-mps"}

                dev = qml.device("default.tensor", wires=num_qubits, **device_kwargs)

                @qml.qnode(dev)
                def circuit(theta, phi, num_qubits):
                    for qubit in range(num_qubits - 4):
                        qml.X(wires=qubit)
                        qml.RX(theta, wires=qubit + 1)
                        qml.CNOT(wires=[qubit, qubit + 1])
                        qml.DoubleExcitation(phi, wires=[qubit, qubit + 1, qubit + 3, qubit + 4])
                        qml.CSWAP(wires=[qubit + 1, qubit + 3, qubit + 4])
                        qml.RY(theta, wires=qubit + 1)
                        qml.Toffoli(wires=[qubit + 1, qubit + 3, qubit + 4])
                    return [
                        qml.expval(qml.Z(0)),
                        qml.expval(qml.Hamiltonian([np.pi, np.e], [qml.Z(15) @ qml.Y(25), qml.Hadamard(40)])),
                        qml.var(qml.Y(20)),
                    ]

            >>> circuit(theta, phi, num_qubits)
            [-0.9953099539219951, 0.0036631029671767208, 0.9999999876072984]

            After the first execution, the time to run this circuit for 50 qubits is around 0.5 seconds depending on the machine.
            Increasing the number of qubits to 500 brings the execution time to approximately 15 seconds, and for 1000 qubits to around 50 seconds.

            The time complexity and the accuracy of the results also depend on the chosen keyword arguments for the device, such as the maximum bond dimension.
            The specific structure of the circuit significantly affects how the time complexity and accuracy of the simulation scale with these parameters.
