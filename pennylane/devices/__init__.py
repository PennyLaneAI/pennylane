This subpackage provides default devices for PennyLane, which do not need external plugins to be installed.
The default devices provide basic built-in qubit
and CV circuit simulators that can be used with PennyLane without the need for additional
dependencies. They may also be used in the PennyLane test suite in order
to verify and test quantum gradient computations.
