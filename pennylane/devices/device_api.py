class Device(abc.ABC):
    """A device driver that can control one or more backends. A backend can be either a physical
    Quantum Processing Unit or a virtual one such as a simulator.

    Only the ``execute`` method must be defined to construct a device driver.

    .. details::
        :title: Design Motivation

        **Streamlined interface:** Only methods that are required to interact with the rest of PennyLane will be placed in the
        interface. Developers will be able to clearly see what they can change while still having a fully functional device.

        **Reduction of duplicate methods:** Methods that solve similar problems are combined together. Only one place will have
        to solve each individual problem.

        **Support for dynamic execution configurations:** Properties such as shots belong to specific executions.

        **Greater coverage for differentiation methods:** Devices can define any order of derivative, the vector jacobian product,
        or the jacobian vector product.  Calculation of derivatives can be done at the same time as execution to allow reuse of intermediate
        results.

    .. details::
        :title: Porting from the old interface

        :meth:`pennylane.Device.batch_execute` and :meth:`~pennylane.Device.execute` are now a single method, :meth:`~.Device.execute`

        :meth:`~.Device.batch_transform` and :meth:`~.Device.expand_fn` are now a single method, :meth:`~.Device.preprocess`

        Shot information is no longer stored on the device, but instead specified on individual input :class:`~.QuantumTape`.

        The old devices defined a :meth:`~.Device.capabilities` dictionary that defined characteristics of the devices and controlled various
        preprocessing and validation steps, such as ``"supports_broadcasting"``.  These capabilites should now be handled by the
        :meth:`~.Device.preprocess` method. For example, if a device does not support broadcasting, ``preprocess`` should
        split a quantum script with broadcasted parameters into a batch of quantum scripts. If the device does not support mid circuit
        measurements, then ``preprocess`` should apply :func:`~.defer_measurements`.  A set of default preprocessing steps will be available
        to make a seamless transition to the new interface.

        A class will be provided to easily construct default preprocessing steps from supported operations, supported observables,
        supported measurement processes, and various capabilities.

        Utility functions will be added to the ``devices`` module to query whether or not the device driver can do certain things, such
        as ``devices.supports_operator(op, dev, native=True)``. These functions will work by checking the behaviour of :meth:`~.Device.preprocess`
        to certain inputs.

        Versioning should be specified by the package containing the device. If an external package includes a PennyLane device,
        then the package requirements should specify the minimium PennyLane version required to work with the device.

    .. details::
        :title: The relationship between preprocessing and execution

        The :meth:`~.preprocess` method is assumed to be run before any :meth:`~.execute` or differentiation method.
        If an arbitrary, non-preprocessed circuit is provided, :meth:`~.execute` has no responsibility to perform any
        validation or provide clearer error messages.

        >>> op = qml.Permute(["c", 3,"a",2,0], wires=[3,2,"a",0,"c"])
        >>> circuit = qml.tape.QuantumScript([op], [qml.state()])
        >>> dev = DefaultQubit()
        >>> dev.execute(circuit)
        MatrixUndefinedError
        >>> circuit = qml.tape.QuantumScript([qml.Rot(1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 0)], [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))])
        >>> config = ExecutionConfig(gradient_method="adjoint")
        >>> dev.compute_derivatives(circuit, config)
        ValueError: Operation Rot is not written in terms of a single parameter
        >>> new_circuit, postprocessing, new_config = dev.preprocess(circuit, config)
        >>> dev.compute_derivatives(new_circuit, new_config)
        ((array(0.), array(-0.74570521), array(0.)),)

        Any validation checks or error messages should occur in :meth:`~.preprocess` to avoid failures after expending
        computation resources.

    .. details::
        :title: Execution Configuration

        Execution config properties related to configuring a device include:

        * ``device_options``: A dictionary of device specific options. For example, the python device may have ``multiprocessing_mode``
          as a key. These should be documented in the class docstring.

        * ``gradient_method``: A device can choose to have native support for any type of gradient method. If the method
          :meth:`~.supports_derivatives` returns ``True`` for a particular gradient method, it will be treated as a device
          derivative and not handled by pennylane core code.

        * ``gradient_keyword_arguments``: Options for the gradient method.

            The result for each :class:`~.QuantumTape` must match the shape specified by :class:`~.QuantumTape.shape`.

            The level of priority for dimensions from outer dimension to inner dimension is:

            2. Shot choice in a shot vector
            3. Measurement in the quantum script
            4. Parameter broadcasting
            5. Measurement shape for array-valued measurements like probabilities

            For a batch of quantum scripts with multiple measurements, a shot vector, and parameter broadcasting:

            * ``result[0]``: the results for the first script
            * ``result[0][0]``: the first shot number in the shot vector
            * ``result[0][0][0]``: the first measurement in the quantum script

            * ``result[0][0][0][0][0]``: the first value for an array-valued measurement

            With the exception of quantum script batches, dimensions with only a single component should be eliminated.

            For example:

            With a single script and a single measurement process, execute should return just the
            measurement value in a numpy array. ``shape`` currently accepts a device, as historically devices
            stored shot information. In the future, this method will accept an ``ExecutionConfig`` instead.

        a batch of circuits.

        If ``circuit`` is not provided, then the method should return whether or not device derivatives exist for **any** circuit.

        **Example:**

        For example, the Python device will support device differentiation via the adjoint differentiation algorithm
        if the order is ``1`` and the execution occurs with no shots (``shots=None``).

        >>> config = ExecutionConfig(derivative_order=2, gradient_method="adjoint")
        >>> dev.supports_derivatives(config)
        False

        Adjoint differentiation will only be supported for circuits with expectation value measurements.
        If a circuit is provided and it cannot be converted to a form supported by differentiation method by
        :meth:`~.Device.preprocess`, then ``supports_derivatives`` should return False.

        >>> config = ExecutionConfig(derivative_order=1, shots=None, gradient_method="adjoint")

        >>> dev.supports_derivatives(config, circuit=circuit)
        False

        If the circuit is not natively supported by the differentiation method but can be converted into a form
        that is supported, it should still return ``True``.  For example, :class:`~.Rot` gates are not natively
        supported by adjoint differentation, as they do not have a generator, but they can be compiled into
        operations supported by adjoint differentiation. Therefore this method may reproduce compilation
        and validation steps performed by :meth:`~.Device.preprocess`.

        parameter. If a number is zero, then the gradient with respect to that parameter does not need to be computed.
