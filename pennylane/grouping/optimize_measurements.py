    """Partitions then diagonalizes a list of Pauli words, facilitating simultaneous measurement of
    all observables within a partition.

    The input list of observables are partitioned into mutually qubit-wise commuting (QWC) or
    mutually commuting partitions by approximately solving minimum clique cover on a graph where
    each observable represents a vertex. The unitaries which diagonalize the partitions are then
    found. See arXiv:1907.03358 and arXiv:1907.09386 for technical details of the QWC and fully
    commuting measurement partitioning approaches respectively.

    **Example usage:**

    >>> observables = [qml.PauliY(0), qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.PauliX(1), qml.PauliZ(1)]
    >>> coefficients = [1.43, 4.21, 0.97]

            instances thereof)

    Keyword args:
        coefficients (list[scalar]): a list of scalar coefficients, for instance the weights of
        the Pauli words comprising a Hamiltonian
        grouping (str): the binary symmetric relation to use for operator partitioning
        colouring_method (str): the graph-colouring heuristic to use in obtaining the operator
            partitions

    Returns:
        post_rotations (list[Template]): a list of the post-rotation qml.Templates instances, one
            for each partition
        diagonalized_groupings (list[list[Observable]]): A list of the obtained groupings. Each
            grouping is itself a list of Pauli words diagonal in the measurement basis.
        grouped_coeffs (list[list[scalar]]): A list of coefficient groupings. Each
            coefficient grouping is itself a list of the partitions corresponding coefficients.
            Only output if coefficients are specified.
