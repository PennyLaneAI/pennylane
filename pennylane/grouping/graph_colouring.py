A module for heuristic algorithms for colouring Pauli graphs.

A Pauli graph is a graph where vertices represent Pauli words and edges denote
if a specified symmetric binary relation (e.g., commutation) is satisfied for the
corresponding Pauli words. The graph-colouring problem is to assign a colour to
each vertex such that no vertices of the same colour are connected, using the
fewest number of colours (lowest "chromatic number") as possible.
