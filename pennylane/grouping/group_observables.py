    """
    Class for partitioning a list of Pauli words according to some binary symmetric relation.

    Partitions are defined by the binary symmetric relation of interest, e.g., all Pauli words in a
    partition being mutually commuting. The partitioning is accomplished by formulating the list of
    Pauli words as a graph where nodes represent Pauli words and edges between nodes denotes that
    the two corresponding Pauli words satisfy the symmetric binary relation.

    Obtaining the fewest number of partitions such that all Pauli terms within a partition mutually
    satisfy the binary relation can then be accomplished by finding a partition of the graph nodes
    such that each partition is a fully connected subgraph (a "clique"). The problem of finding the
    optimal partitioning, i.e., the fewest number of cliques, is the minimum clique cover (MCC)
    problem. The solution of MCC may be found by graph colouring on the complementary graph. Both
    MCC and graph colouring are NP-Hard, so heuristic graph colouring algorithms are employed to
    find approximate solutions in polynomial time.

    Args:
        observables (list[Observable]): a list of Pauli words to be partitioned according to a
            grouping strategy
        grouping_type (str): the binary relation used to define partitions of
            the Pauli words, can be ``'qwc'`` (qubit-wise commuting), ``'commuting'``, or
            ``'anticommuting'``.
        graph_colourer (str): the heuristic algorithm to employ for graph
            colouring, can be ``'lf'`` (Largest First) or ``'rlf'`` (Recursive
            Largest First)
