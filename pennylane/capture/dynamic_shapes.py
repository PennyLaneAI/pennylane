    Returns:

    Note that "dynamic shapes" only refers to the size of dimensions, but not the number of dimensions.
    Even with dynamic shapes mode enabled, we cannot change the number of dimensions.

    See the ``intro_to_dynamic_shapes.md`` document for more information on how dynamic shapes work.

    To make jaxpr from arguments with dynamic shapes, the ``abstracted_axes`` keyword argument must be set.
    Then, when calling the jaxpr, variables for the dynamic shapes must be passed.

    For cases where the shape of an argnument matches a previous argument like:

    >>> def f(i, x):
    ...    return x
    >>> def workflow(i):
    ...     args = (i, jax.numpy.ones((i, )))
    ...     abstracted_axes, abstract_shapes = qml.capture.determine_abstracted_axes(args)

    We allow Jax to identify that the shape of ``b`` matches our first argument, ``a``. This is
    demonstrated by the fact that we do not have any additional ``abstract_shapes``, as it is already
    present in the call signature.  The abstracted axis is also `"a_arg"` instead of `"a"`.
    The ``"_arg"`` at the end indicates that the corresponding abstract axis
    was already in the argument loop.âˆ‚
