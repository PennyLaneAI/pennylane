    Note that "dynamic shapes" only refers to the size of dimensions, but not the number of dimensions.
    Even with dynamic shapes mode enabled, we cannot change the number of dimensions.

    See the ``intro_to_dynamic_shapes.md`` document for more information on how dynamic shapes work.

    To make jaxpr from arguments with dynamic shapes, the ``abstracted_axes`` keyword argument must be set.
    Then, when calling the jaxpr, variables for the dynamic shapes must be passed.
