class ClassicalShadow:
    r"""Class for classical shadow post-processing expectation values, approximate states, and entropies.

    A ``ClassicalShadow`` is a classical description of a quantum state that is capable of reproducing expectation values of local Pauli observables, see `2002.08953 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08953>`_.

    The idea is to capture :math:`T` local snapshots (given by the ``shots`` set in the device) of the state by performing measurements in random Pauli bases at each qubit.
    The measurement outcomes, denoted ``bits``, as well as the choices of measurement bases, ``recipes``, are recorded in two ``(T, len(wires))`` integer tensors, respectively.

    From the :math:`t`-th measurement, we can reconstruct the ``local_snapshots`` (see methods)

    .. math:: \rho^{(t)} = \bigotimes_{i=1}^{n} 3 U^\dagger_i |b_i \rangle \langle b_i | U_i - \mathbb{I},

    where :math:`U_i` is the rotation corresponding to the measurement (e.g. :math:`U_i=H` for measurement in :math:`X`) of qubit :math:`i` at snapshot :math:`t` and :math:`|b_i\rangle = (1 - b_i, b_i)`
    the corresponding computational basis state given the output bit :math:`b_i`.

    From these local snapshots, one can compute expectation values of local Pauli strings, where locality refers to the number of non-Identity operators.
    The accuracy of the procedure is determined by the number of measurements :math:`T` (``shots``).
    To target an error :math:`\epsilon`, one needs of order :math:`T = \mathcal{O}\left( \log(M) 4^\ell/\epsilon^2 \right)` measurements to determine :math:`M` different,
    :math:`\ell`-local observables.

    One can in principle also reconstruct the global state :math:`\sum_t \rho^{(t)}/T`, though it is not advisable nor practical for larger systems due to its exponential scaling.

    .. note:: As per `arXiv:2103.07510 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07510>`_, when computing multiple expectation values it is advisable to directly estimate the desired observables by simultaneously measuring
        qubit-wise-commuting terms. One way of doing this in PennyLane is via :class:`~pennylane.Hamiltonian` and setting ``grouping_type="qwc"``. For more details on this topic, see our demo
        on `estimating expectation values with classical shadows <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_diffable_shadows.html>`_.

    Args:
        bits (tensor): recorded measurement outcomes in random Pauli bases.
        recipes (tensor): recorded measurement bases.
        wire_map (list[int]): list of the measured wires in the order that
            they appear in the columns of ``bits`` and ``recipes``. If None, defaults
            to ``range(n)``, where ``n`` is the number of measured wires.

    .. seealso:: Demo on `Estimating observables with classical shadows in the Pauli basis <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_diffable_shadows.html>`_, :func:`~.pennylane.classical_shadow`

    **Example**

    We obtain the ``bits`` and ``recipes`` via :func:`~.pennylane.classical_shadow` measurement:

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=range(2), shots=1000)
        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def qnode(x):
            qml.Hadamard(0)
            qml.CNOT((0,1))
            qml.RX(x, wires=0)
            return qml.classical_shadow(wires=range(2))

        bits, recipes = qnode(0)
        shadow = qml.ClassicalShadow(bits, recipes)

    After recording these ``T=1000`` quantum measurements, we can post-process the results to arbitrary local expectation values of Pauli strings.
    For example, we can compute the expectation value of a Pauli string

    >>> shadow.expval(qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.PauliX(1), k=1)
    array(0.972)

    or of a Hamiltonian:

    >>> H = qml.Hamiltonian([1., 1.], [qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1), qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.PauliX(1)])
    >>> shadow.expval(H, k=1)
    array(1.917)

    The parameter ``k`` is used to estimate the expectation values via the `median of means` algorithm (see `2002.08953 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08953>`_). The case ``k=1`` corresponds to simply taking the mean
    value over all local snapshots. ``k>1`` corresponds to splitting the ``T`` local snapshots into ``k`` equal parts, and taking the median of their individual means. For the case of measuring only in the Pauli basis,
    there is no advantage expected from setting ``k>1``.

def pauli_expval(bits, recipes, word):
    r"""
    The approximate expectation value of a Pauli word given the bits and recipes
    from a classical shadow measurement.

    The expectation value can be computed using

    .. math::

        \alpha = \frac{1}{|T_{match}|}\sum_{T_{match}}\left(1 - 2\left(\sum b \text{  mod }2\right)\right)

    where :math:`T_{match}` denotes the snapshots with recipes that match the Pauli word,
    and the right-most sum is taken over all bits in the snapshot where the observable
    in the Pauli word for that bit is not the identity.

    Args:
        bits (tensor-like[int]): An array with shape ``(T, n)``, where ``T`` is the
            number of snapshots and ``n`` is the number of measured qubits. Each
            entry must be either ``0`` or ``1`` depending on the sample for the
            corresponding snapshot and qubit.
        recipes (tensor-like[int]): An array with shape ``(T, n)``. Each entry
            must be either ``0``, ``1``, or ``2`` depending on the selected Pauli
            measurement for the corresponding snapshot and qubit. ``0`` corresponds
            to PauliX, ``1`` to PauliY, and ``2`` to PauliZ.
        word (tensor-like[int]): An array with shape ``(n,)``. Each entry must be
            either ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, or ``-1`` depending on the Pauli observable
            on each qubit. For example, when ``n=3``, the observable ``PauliY(0) @ PauliX(2)``
            corresponds to the word ``np.array([1 -1 0])``.

    Returns:
        tensor-like[float]: An array with shape ``(T,)`` containing the value
        of the Pauli observable for each snapshot. The expectation can be
        found by averaging across the snapshots.
