def generate_scf(mol, n_steps=50, tol=1e-8):
    r"""Return a function that performs the self-consistent-field calculations.

    In the Hartree-Fock method, molecular orbitals are typically constructed as a linear combination
    of atomic orbitals

    .. math::

        \phi_i(r) = \sum_{\mu} C_{\mu i} \chi_{\mu}(r),

    with coefficients :math:`C_{\mu i}` that are initially unknown. The self-consistent-field
    iterations are performed to find a converged set of molecular orbital coefficients that minimize
    the total energy of the molecular system. This optimization problem can be reduced to solving a
    linear system of equations which are usually written as

    .. math::

        FC = SCE,

    where :math:`E` is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, representing the molecular orbital
    energies, :math:`C` is the matrix of molecular orbital coefficients, :math:`S` is the overlap
    matrix and :math:`F` is the Fock matrix, which also depends on the coefficients. Fixing an
    initial guess :math:`C_0`, the corresponding :math:`F_0` is built and the system
    :math:`F_0C_0 = SC_0E` is solved to obtain a solution :math:`C_1`. This process is iteratively
    repeated until the coefficients are converged.

    The key step in in this process is constructing the Fock matrix which is defined as

    .. math::

        F = H + \frac{1}{2} J - K,

    where :math:`H`, :math:`J` and :math:`K` are the core Hamiltonian matrix, Coulomb matrix and
    exchange matrix, respectively. The entries of :math:`H` are computed from the electronic kinetic
    energy and the electron-nuclear attraction integrals, which are integrals over atomic basis
    functions. The elements of the :math:`J` and :math:`K` matrices are obtained from the Coulomb
    and exchange integrals over the basis functions.

    Following the procedure in
    [`Lehtola et al. Molecules 2020, 25, 1218 <https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/5/1218>`_], we
    express the molecular orbital coefficients in terms of a matrix :math:`X` as
    :math:`C = X \tilde{C}` which gives the following transformed equation

    .. math::

         \tilde{F} \tilde{C} = \tilde{S} \tilde{C} E,

    where :math:`\tilde{F} = X^T F X`, :math:`\tilde{S} = X^T S X` and :math:`S` is the overlap
    matrix. We chose :math:`X` such that :math:`\tilde{S} = 1` as

    .. math::

        X = V \Lambda^{-1/2} V^T,

    where :math:`V` and :math:`\Lambda` are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of :math:`S`,
    respectively. This gives the eigenvalue equation

    .. math::

         \tilde{F}\tilde{C} = \tilde{C}E,

    which is solved with conventional methods iteratively.

        mol (Molecule): the molecule object
        n_steps (int): the number of iterations
        tol (float): convergence tolerance
