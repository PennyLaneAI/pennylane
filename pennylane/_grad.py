    """Returns the gradient as a callable function of (functions of) QNodes.

    By default, gradients are computed for arguments which contain the property
    ``requires_grad=True``. Alternatively, the ``argnum`` keyword argument can
    be specified to compute gradients for function arguments without this property,
    such as scalars, lists, tuples, dicts, or vanilla NumPy arrays. Setting
    ``argnum`` to the index of an argument with ``requires_grad=False`` will raise
    a ``NonDifferentiableError``.

    When the output gradient function is executed, both the forward pass
    *and* the backward pass will be performed in order to
    compute the gradient. The value of the forward pass is available via the
    :attr:`~.forward` property.

def jacobian(func, argnum=None):
    """Returns the Jacobian as a callable function of vector-valued
    (functions of) QNodes.

    This is a wrapper around the :mod:`autograd.jacobian` function.

    Args:
        func (function): A vector-valued Python function or QNode that contains
            a combination of quantum and classical nodes. The output of the computation
            must consist of a single NumPy array (if classical) or a tuple of
            expectation values (if a quantum node)
        argnum (int or Sequence[int]): Which argument to take the gradient
            with respect to. If a sequence is given, the Jacobian corresponding
            to all marked inputs and all output elements is returned.

    Returns:
        function: the function that returns the Jacobian of the input
        function with respect to the arguments in argnum

    .. note::
        Due to a limitation in Autograd, this function can only differentiate built-in scalar
        or NumPy array arguments.

    For ``argnum=None``, the trainable arguments are inferred dynamically from the arguments
    passed to the function. The returned function takes the same arguments as the original
    function and outputs a ``tuple``. The ``i`` th entry of the ``tuple`` has shape
    ``(*output shape, *shape of args[argnum[i]])``.

    If a single trainable argument is inferred, or if a single integer
    is provided as ``argnum``, the tuple is unpacked and its only entry is returned instead.

    **Example**

    Consider the QNode

    .. code-block::

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(weights):
            qml.RX(weights[0, 0, 0], wires=0)
            qml.RY(weights[0, 0, 1], wires=1)
            qml.RZ(weights[1, 0, 2], wires=0)
            return qml.probs()

        weights = np.array(
            [[[0.2, 0.9, -1.4]], [[0.5, 0.2, 0.1]]], requires_grad=True
        )

    It has a single array-valued QNode argument with shape ``(2, 1, 3)`` and outputs
    the probability of each 2-wire basis state, of which there are ``2**num_wires`` = 4.
    Therefore, the Jacobian of this QNode will be a single array with shape ``(2, 2, 1, 3)``:

    >>> qml.jacobian(circuit)(weights).shape
    (4, 2, 1, 3)

    On the other hand, consider the following QNode for the same circuit
    structure:

    .. code-block::

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x, y, z):
            qml.RX(x, wires=0)
            qml.RY(y, wires=1)
            qml.RZ(z, wires=0)
            return tuple(qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(w)) for w in dev.wires)

        x = np.array(0.2, requires_grad=True)
        y = np.array(0.9, requires_grad=True)
        z = np.array(-1.4, requires_grad=True)

    It has three scalar QNode arguments and outputs the probability for each of
    the 4 basis states. Consequently, its Jacobian will be a three-tuple of
    arrays with the shape ``(4,)``:

    >>> jac = qml.jacobian(circuit)(x, y, z)
    >>> type(jac)
    tuple
    >>> for sub_jac in jac:
    ...     print(sub_jac.shape)
    (4,)
    (4,)
    (4,)

    For a more advanced setting of QNode arguments, consider the QNode

    .. code-block::

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x, y):
            qml.RX(x[0], wires=0)
            qml.RY(y[0, 3], wires=1)
            qml.RX(x[1], wires=2)
            return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(w)) for w in [0, 1, 2]]

        x = np.array([0.1, 0.5], requires_grad=True)
        y = np.array([[-0.3, 1.2, 0.1, 0.9], [-0.2, -3.1, 0.5, -0.7]], requires_grad=True)

    If we do not provide ``argnum``, ``qml.jacobian`` will correctly identify both,
    ``x`` and ``y``, as trainable function arguments:

    >>> jac = qml.jacobian(circuit)(x, y)
    >>> print(type(jac), len(jac))
    <class 'tuple'> 2
    >>> qml.math.shape(jac[0])
    (8, 2)
    >>> qml.math.shape(jac[1])
    (8, 2, 4)

    As we can see, there are two entries in the output, one Jacobian for each
    QNode argument. The shape ``(8, 2)`` of the first Jacobian is the combination
    of the QNode output shape (``(8,)``) and the shape of ``x`` (``(2,)``).
    Similarly, the shape ``(2, 4)`` of ``y`` leads to a Jacobian shape ``(8, 2, 4)``.

    Instead we may choose the output to contain only one of the two
    entries by providing an iterable as ``argnum``:

    >>> jac = qml.jacobian(circuit, argnum=[1])(x, y)
    >>> print(type(jac), len(jac))
    <class 'tuple'> 1
    >>> qml.math.shape(jac)
    (1, 8, 2, 4)

    Here we included the size of the tuple in the shape analysis, corresponding to the
    first dimension of size ``1``.

    Finally, we may want to receive the single entry above directly, not as a tuple
    with a single entry. This is done by providing a single integer as ``argnum``

    >>> jac = qml.jacobian(circuit, argnum=1)(x, y)
    >>> print(type(jac), len(jac))
    <class 'numpy.ndarray'> 8
    >>> qml.math.shape(jac)
    (8, 2, 4)

    As expected, the tuple was unpacked and we directly received the Jacobian of the
    QNode with respect to ``y``.
