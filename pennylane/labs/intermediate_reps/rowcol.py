        starting at ``source``. Strictly speaking, the traversal is encoded in the first
        entry of each pair, and the second entry simply is the parent node for each first entry.

    A useful illustration of depth-first tree traversals can be found on
    `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Depth-first%20search>`__.

    **Example**

    Consider the tree

    .. code-block:: python

                          (4)
                           |
        (6) - (2) - (0) - (1) - (3) - (8)
               |           |
              (7)         (5)

    and consider ``(0)`` to be the source, or root, of the tree.
    We may construct this tree as a ``nx.Graph`` by providing the edge data:

    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8)])

    As for every tree traversal, post-order traversal results in a reordering of the nodes of
    the tree, with each node appearing exactly once. Post-order traversing the graph means that
    for every node we reach, we first visit its child nodes (in standard sorting of the node
    labels/indices) and then append the node itself to the ordering.

    The post-order traversal reads ``[8, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6, 7, 2, 0]``.
    For the output convention of this function, each node is accompanied by its
    parent node, because this is useful information needed down the line, and it is not easy to
    retrieve from the ``nx.Graph`` itself. In addition, the last entry, which always is the root
    of the tree provided via the ``source`` argument, is *not* included in the output.

    >>> from pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps import postorder_traverse
    >>> traversal = postorder_traverse(G, 0)
    >>> print(traversal)
    [(8, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (1, 0), (6, 2), (7, 2), (2, 0)]

    >>> all(child == exp for (child, parent), exp in zip(traversal, expected, strict=True))
    True

      To see how this comes about, start at the root ``(0)`` and perform the following steps:

      #. Visit ``(1)``, ``(3)`` and then ``(8)``, without appending any of them.
      #. Append ``(8)`` because there are no child nodes to visit (it is a leaf node).
      #. Append ``(3)`` because all children of it have been visited.
      #. Visit the next child of ``(1)``, which is ``(4)``, and append it because it is a leaf node.
      #. Visit the last child of ``(1)``, which is ``(5)``, and append it because it is a leaf node.
      #. Append ``(1)`` because all its children have been visited.
      #. Visit ``(2)`` and then ``(6)``, the latter of which is appended (leaf node).
      #. Visit the second and last child of ``(2))``, which is ``(7)``, and append it (leaf node).
      #. Append ``(2)`` becaues all its children have been visited.
      #. Append ``(0)`` becaues all its children have been visited.

    but is used for the internal recursive structure.

        ``pip install galois``, for details see
        `its documentation <https://mhostetter.github.io/galois/latest/>`__.

    **Example**

    Here we compute the example 1 from `Wu et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14478>`__ in code.
    We also compute it by hand in the manual example section below.

    To start, we have the connectivity graph

    .. code-block:: python

        (0) - (3) - (4)
               |
              (2)
               |
              (1)

    and define it in code as a ``networkx.Graph``
    (`networkx documentation <https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html>`__).

    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)])

    We would like to find a CNOT circuit implementing the following parity matrix ``P``:

    >>> P = np.array([
    ...     [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    ...     [0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    ...     [1, 0, 1, 0 ,1],
    ...     [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    ...     [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    ... ])

    We import ``rowcol`` and the function ``parity_matrix`` that will allow us to
    check that the computed circuit produces the input parity matrix.
    Then we run the algorithm:

    >>> from pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps import rowcol, parity_matrix
    >>> cnots = rowcol(P, G)

    The constructed circuit is the one found in the paper as well:

    >>> circ = qml.tape.QuantumScript([qml.CNOT(pair) for pair in cnots])
    >>> print(qml.drawer.tape_text(circ, wire_order=range(5)))
    0: ──────────────────────────────────╭X───────╭X─╭●───────┤
    1: ─────────────╭X───────╭X─╭●────╭X─│────────│──│────────┤
    2: ────╭X────╭●─╰●────╭X─╰●─╰X─╭●─╰●─│─────╭●─│──│─────╭X─┤
    3: ─╭X─╰●─╭X─╰X─╭●─╭X─╰●─╭X────╰X────╰●─╭X─╰X─╰●─╰X─╭●─╰●─┤
    4: ─╰●────╰●────╰X─╰●────╰●─────────────╰●──────────╰X────┤

    We can confirm that this circuit indeed implements the original parity matrix:

    >>> recon_P = parity_matrix(circ, wire_order=range(5))
    >>> np.allclose(P, recon_P)
    True

        :title: Algorithm overview
        :href: algorithm-overview

        Given a parity matrix :math:`P` and a connectivity graph :math:`G(V, E)`, as well as an
        empty list ``L`` to which we will append CNOT gates,
        the algorithm consists of the following steps:

        #. If :math:`|V|=1` (there is a single node), go to step 5. Else, select a vertex
           :math:`i\in V` that is not a cut vertex, i.e. a vertex that we can remove without
           disconnecting the graph.
        #. Eliminate column ``P[:, i]``
            a. Construct :math:`S = \{j | P_{ji} \neq 0\} \cup \{i\}` and find a Steiner tree
               :math:`T \supseteq S`.
            b. `Post-order traverse <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Post-order,_LRN>`__
               the Steiner tree :math:`T` starting from :math:`i` as root. If ``P[c, i]=1`` for node
               :math:`c` in the traversal and ``P[p, i]=0`` for parent node :math:`p` of node :math:`c`,
               add row ``P[c]`` to row ``P[p]`` and append ``CNOT([c, p])`` to ``L``.
            c. Post-order traverse :math:`T` again starting from :math:`i`. For each node :math:`p`
               in the traversal, add row ``P[p]`` to row ``P[c]``, where :math:`c` is the child node
               of :math:`p`, and append ``CNOT([p, c])`` to ``L``.
        #. Eliminate row ``P[i]``
            a. Construct :math:`S'` such that the corresponding rows of :math:`P` add up to the
               :math:`i`\ th basis vector, :math:`\sum_{j\in S'} P[j] = e_i`. Find a Steiner tree
               :math:`T' \supseteq S'`.
            b. `Pre-order traverse <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order,_NLR>`__
               the Steiner tree :math:`T'` starting from :math:`i` and for each node :math:`c` in
               the traversal for which :math:`c \notin S'`, add row :math:`P[c]` to row :math:`P[p]`,
               where :math:`p` is the parent node of :math:`c`, and append ``CNOT([c, p])`` to ``L``.
            c. Post-order traverse :math:`T` starting from :math:`i`. For each node :math:`c`
               in the traversal, add row ``P[c]`` to row ``P[p]``, where :math:`p` is the parent node
               of :math:`c`, and append ``CNOT([c, p])`` to ``L``.
        #. Delete vertex :math:`i` from :math:`G` and ignore row and column with index :math:`i` in
           the following. Go to step 1.
        #. Revert the list ``L`` of CNOT gates in order to go from the circuit that transforms
           :math:`P` to the identity to the circuit that implements :math:`P` starting from the
           identity.

    .. details::
        :title: Manual example
        :href: manual-example

        We walk through example 1 in `Wu et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14478>`__, which
        was demonstrated in code above, in detail. The steps are numbered according to
        the algorithm overview above.
        We restrict ourselves to the following connectivity graph.

        .. code-block:: python

            (0) - (3) - (4)
                   |
                  (2)
                   |
                  (1)

        We look at a CNOT circuit with the following parity matrix. The first column is
        highlighted as we are going to start by eliminating it (``(0)`` is not a cut vertex).

        .. math::

            P = \begin{pmatrix}
                \color{blue}1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
                \color{blue}0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
                \color{blue}1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
                \color{blue}1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                \color{blue}1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0
            \end{pmatrix}

        *Step 1:* Pick vertex ``i=0``

        *Step 2:* Eliminate ``P[:, 0]``

        *Step 2.a:* Find :math:`S` and :math:`T`

        All non-zero vertices are ``S = [0, 2, 3, 4]``. A Steiner tree ``T`` connecting those
        vertices is given by

        .. code-block:: python

            (0) - (3) - (4)
                   |
                  (2)

        *Step 2.b:* First post-order traversal

        We post-order traverse :math:`T` from :math:`0`, giving the ordering :math:`[2, 4, 3, 0]`,
        and check for nodes :math:`c` with parent :math:`p` where :math:`P_{ci}=0` and
        :math:`P_{pi}=1`. This can only happen when we have elements in :math:`T` that are not in
        :math:`S` or when the vertex :math:`i` itself has a value :math:`0`. Neither is the case here;
        therefore, no action is required.

        *Step 2.c:* Second post-order traversal

        We again post-order traverse the tree and add *every* vertex to its children, i.e.
        we get the CNOT operations :math:`\text{CNOT}_{3 2} \text{CNOT}_{3 4} \text{CNOT}_{0 3}`.
        Simultaneously, we update the parity matrix with the corresponding row additions (modulo 2).

        .. math::

            P = \begin{pmatrix}
                1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
                0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
                0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
                0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
                0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0
            \end{pmatrix}.

        *Step 3:* Eliminate ``P[0, :]``

        Now we eliminate the first row, marked blue below.

        .. math::

            P = \begin{pmatrix}
                \color{blue}1 & \color{blue}1 & \color{blue}0 & \color{blue}1 & \color{blue}1 \\
                0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
                0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
                0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
                0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0
            \end{pmatrix}

        *Step 3.a:* Find :math:`S'` and :math:`T'`

        We see that we can add rows :math:`S' = \{0, 2, 4\}` together to obtain the
        first unit vector :math:`e_0`.
        The Steiner tree :math:`T'` encapsulating :math:`S'` is then

        .. code-block:: python

            (0) - (3) - (4)
                   |
                  (2)

        where :math:`3 \notin S'`.

        *Step 3.b:* Pre-order traverse

        We pre-order traverse :math:`T'` (yielding :math:`[0, 3, 2, 4]`) and for all
        :math:`c \notin S'`, we add them to their parent. In particular, we get an
        additional :math:`\text{CNOT}_{3 0}`.
        This is necessary because we are going to traverse through this node in the next step and we
        need to undo this step again to eliminate the targeted row.

        *Step 3.c:* Post-order traverse

        Similarly to step 2.c, we post-order traverse :math:`T'`, but this time adding every node's
        row to that of its parent. This yields the same circuit as in step 2.c (because the Steiner
        trees are the same), but with the roles of target and control qubits reversed.

        *Step 4:* Delete and iterate

        We delete vertex :math:`i=0` from :math:`G` and ignore the first row and column of :math:`P`
        in the following. Then we return to step 1.

        *Step 1:* Pick vertex ``i=1``

        *Step 2:* Eliminate ``P[:, 1]``

        We repeat the procedure for the next vertex :math:`i=1` from the resulting parity matrix

        .. math::

            P = \begin{pmatrix}
                1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                0 & \color{blue}0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
                0 & \color{blue}1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
                0 & \color{blue}1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                0 & \color{blue}0 & 1 & 0 & 0
            \end{pmatrix}.

        *Step 2.a:* Find :math:`S` and :math:`T`

        The set :math:`S` of non-zero entries in column ``P[:,1]`` together with :math:`i` itself
        is :math:`S = [1, 2, 3]` and the encapsulating Steiner tree :math:`T` is simply

        .. code-block:: python

            (3)
             |
            (2)
             |
            (1)

        *Step 2.b:* First post-order traversal

        We post-order traverse :math:`T` from :math:`1` (yielding :math:`[3, 2, 1]`) to check
        if any parent has :math:`P_{pi}=0`, which is the case for :math:`p=1`, so we add
        :math:`\text{CNOT}_{2 1}`.

        *Step 2.c:* Second post-order traversal

        Once again, add every parent node row to the row of its children while post-order traversing.
        We additionally get :math:`\text{CNOT}_{2 3}\text{CNOT}_{1 2}`.

        *Step 3:* Eliminate ``P[1]``

        Now we eliminate the second row, marked blue below.

        .. math::

            P = \begin{pmatrix}
                1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                0 & \color{blue}1 & \color{blue}0 & \color{blue}0 & \color{blue}1 \\
                0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
                0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
                0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0
            \end{pmatrix}

        *Step 3.a:* Find :math:`S'` and :math:`T'`

        We first construct :math:`S' = [1, 3, 4]`, which labels rows whose sum yields :math:`e_1`.
        The encapsulating Steiner tree :math:`T'` is

        .. code-block:: python

            (3) - (4)
             |
            (2)
             |
            (1)

        where :math:`2 \notin S'`.

        *Step 3.b:* Pre-order traverse

        Add :math:`2 \notin S'` to its parent during pre-order traversal (:math:`[1, 2, 3, 4]`),
        i.e. add :math:`\text{CNOT}_{2 1}`.

        *Step 3.c:* Post-order traverse

        Post-order traverse the tree (:math:`[4, 3, 2, 1]`) and add every row to its parent:
        :math:`\text{CNOT}_{4 3}\text{CNOT}_{3 2}\text{CNOT}_{2 1}`.

        *Step 4:* Delete and iterate

        We delete vertex :math:`i=1` from :math:`G` and ignore the second row and column of :math:`P`
        in the following. Then we return to step 1.

        **Remaining operations**

        At this point, we have covered all the cases. We defer to the compilation hub
        for a more extensive explanation of this example and here simply list the remaining gates.

        *Step 1:* Select vertex :math:`i=2`

        *Step 2.b:* :math:`\text{CNOT}_{4 3}`

        *Step 2.c:* :math:`\text{CNOT}_{3 4}\text{CNOT}_{2 3}`

        *Step 3.a:* no gate

        *Step 3.c:* :math:`\text{CNOT}_{4 3}\text{CNOT}_{3 2}`

        *Step 4:* Delete :math:`i=2`

        *Step 1:* Select vertex :math:`i=3`

        *Step 2.b:* no gate

        *Step 2.c:* no gate

        *Step 3.a:* no gate

        *Step 3.c:* :math:`\text{CNOT}_{4 3}`

        *Step 4:* Delete :math:`i=3`

        *Step 1:* :math:`|V|=|\{4\}|=1`, terminate.

        The final circuit is the reverse of the synthesized subcircuits, matching the
        result from the code example above:
