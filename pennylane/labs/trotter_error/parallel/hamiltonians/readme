DIRECTORY: VCHLIB

This directory is for storing Vibronic coupling Hamiltonians as pickled Python objects.
They are read by doing:

```
import pickle

filehandler = open('NAME.pkl', 'rb')
omegas, couplings = pickle.load(filehandler)
```

where omegas is a 1d array of length `p`, and couplings is a list of the coupling arrays. The coupling arrays are 
ordered in `couplings` by ascending order in Q. Typically:

```
couplings[0] : (n,n) shaped array of constant couplings 
couplings[1] : (n,n,p) shaped array of couplings linear in Qs
couplings[2] : (n,n,p,p) shaped array of couplings quadratic in Qs
```

where `n` is the number of states and `p` is the number of vibrational modes
