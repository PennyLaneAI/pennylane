def structure_constants_dense(g: TensorLike) -> TensorLike:
    r"""
    Compute the structure constants that make up the adjoint representation of a Lie algebra.

    This function computes the structure constants of a Lie algebra provided by their dense matrix representation,
    obtained from, e.g., :func:`~lie_closure_dense`.
    This is sometimes more efficient than using the sparse Pauli representations of :class:`~PauliWord` and
    `~PauliSentence` that are employed in :func:`~structure_constants`, e.g., when ther are few but dense sums of Paulis.

    .. seealso:: For details on the mathematical definitions, see :func:`~structure_constants` and the section "Lie algebra basics" in our `g-sim demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_liesim/#lie-algebra-basics>`__.

    Args:
        g (np.array): The (dynamical) Lie algebra provided as dense matrices, as generated from :func:`pennylane.labs.lie.lie_closure_dense`.

    Returns:
        TensorLike: The adjoint representation of shape ``(d, d, d)``, corresponding to indices ``(gamma, alpha, beta)``.

    **Example**

    Let us generate the DLA of the transverse field Ising model using :func:`~lie_closure_dense`.

    >>> n = 4
    >>> gens = [X(i) @ X(i+1) + Y(i) @ Y(i+1) + Z(i) @ Z(i+1) for i in range(n-1)]
    >>> g = lie_closure_dense(gens)
    >>> g.shape
    (12, 16, 16)

    The dimension of the DLA is :math:`d = 12`. Hence, the structure constants have shape ``(12, 12, 12)``.

    >>> adj = structure_constants_dense(g)
    >>> adj.shape
    (12, 12, 12)

    The structure constants tell us the commutation relation between operators in the DLA via

    .. math:: [i G_\alpha, i G_\beta] = \sum_{\gamma = 0}^{d-1} f^\gamma_{\alpha, \beta} iG_\gamma.

    Let us confirm those with an example. Take :math:`[iG_1, iG_3] = [iZ_0, -iY_0 X_1] = -i 2 X_0 X_1 = -i 2 G_0`, so
    we should have :math:`f^0_{1, 3} = -2`, which is indeed the case.

    >>> adjoint_rep[0, 1, 3]
    -2.0

    We can also look at the overall adjoint action of the first element :math:`G_0 = X_{0} \otimes X_{1}` of the DLA on other elements.
    In particular, at :math:`\left(\text{ad}(iG_0)\right)_{\alpha, \beta} = f^0_{\alpha, \beta}`, which corresponds to the following matrix.

    >>> adjoint_rep[0]
    array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [-0.,  0.,  0., -2.,  0.,  0.],
           [-0.,  0.,  0.,  0., -2.,  0.],
           [-0.,  2., -0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [-0., -0.,  2.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0., -0., -0., -0., -0.,  0.]])

    Note that we neither enforce nor assume normalization by default.
