    r"""Khaneja-Glaser involution

    .. warning:: This involution currently only works with Pauli words, either presented as PennyLane operators or :class:`~PauliSentence` instances.

    Args:
        op (PauliSentence): Input operator
        wire (int): Qubit wire on which to perform KG decomposition

    Returns:
        bool: Accordingly to whether ``op`` should go to the even or odd subspace of the decomposition

    .. seealso:: :func:`~cartan_decomposition`

    **Example**

    Let us perform a full recursive Khaneja-Glaser decomposition of :math:`\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{su}(8)`, i.e. the Lie algebra of all Pauli words on 3 qubits.

    >>> g = list(qml.pauli.pauli_group(3)) # su(8)
    >>> g = [_.pauli_rep for _ in g]
    >>> g = g[1:] # remove identity

    We perform the first iteration on the first qubit. We use :func:`~cartan_decomposition`.

    >>> from functools import partial
    >>> k0, m0 = cartan_decomposition(g, partial(khaneja_glaser_involution, wire=0))
    >>> print(f"First iteration: {len(k0)}, {len(m0)}")
    First iteration: 31, 32
    >>> assert qml.labs.dla.check_cartan_decomp(k0, m0) # check Cartan commutation relations of subspaces

    We continue this recursive process on the :math:`\mathfrak{k}` subalgebra with the other two wires.

    >>> k1, m1 = cartan_decomposition(k0, partial(khaneja_glaser_involution, wire=1))
    >>> assert check_cartan_decomp(k1, m1)
    >>> print(f"Second iteration: {len(k1)}, {len(m1)}")
    Second iteration: 15, 16

    >>> k2, m2 = cartan_decomposition(k1, partial(khaneja_glaser_involution, wire=2))
    >>> assert check_cartan_decomp(k2, m2)
    >>> print(f"Third iteration: {len(k2)}, {len(m2)}")
    Third iteration: 7, 8
