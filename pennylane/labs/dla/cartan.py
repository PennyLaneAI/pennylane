def cartan_decomp(

) -> Tuple[List[Union[PauliSentence, Operator]], List[Union[PauliSentence, Operator]]]:
    r"""Cartan Decomposition :math:`\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{m}`.

    Given a Lie algebra :math:`\mathfrak{g}`, the Cartan decomposition is a decomposition
    :math:`\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{m}` into orthogonal complements.
    This is realized by an involution :math:`\Theta(g)` that maps each operator :math:`g \in \mathfrak{g}`
    back to itself after two consecutive applications, i.e., :math:`\Theta(\Theta(g)) = g \ \forall g \in \mathfrak{g}`.

    The ``involution`` argument can be any function that maps the operators in the provided ``g`` to a boolean output.
    ``True`` for operators that go into :math:`\mathfrak{k}` and ``False`` for operators in :math:`\mathfrak{m}`.

    The resulting subspaces fulfill the Cartan commutation relations

    .. math:: [\mathfrak{k}, \mathfrak{k}] \subseteq \mathfrak{k} \text{ ; } [\mathfrak{k}, \mathfrak{m}] \subseteq \mathfrak{m} \text{ ; } [\mathfrak{m}, \mathfrak{m}] \subseteq \mathfrak{k}

    Args:
        g (List[Union[PauliSentence, Operator]]): the (dynamical) Lie algebra to decompose
        involution (callable): Involution function :math:`\Theta(\cdot)` to act on the input operator, should return ``0/1`` or ``False/True``.
            E.g., :func:`~even_odd_involution` or :func:`~concurrence_involution`.

    Returns:
        Tuple(List[Union[PauliSentence, Operator]], List[Union[PauliSentence, Operator]]): Tuple ``(k, m)`` containing the even
            parity subspace :math:`\Theta(\mathfrak{k}) = \mathfrak{k}` and the odd
            parity subspace :math:`\Theta(\mathfrak{m}) = -\mathfrak{m}`.

    .. seealso:: :func:`~even_odd_involution`, :func:`~concurrence_involution`, :func:`~check_cartan_decomp`

    **Example**

    We first construct a Lie algebra.

    >>> from pennylane import X, Z
    >>> from pennylane.labs.dla import concurrence_involution, even_odd_involution, cartan_decomp
    >>> generators = [X(0) @ X(1), Z(0), Z(1)]
    >>> g = qml.lie_closure(generators)
    >>> g
    [X(0) @ X(1),
     Z(0),
     Z(1),
     -1.0 * (Y(0) @ X(1)),
     -1.0 * (X(0) @ Y(1)),
     -1.0 * (Y(0) @ Y(1))]

    We compute the Cartan decomposition with respect to the :func:`~concurrence_involution`.

    >>> k, m = cartan_decomp(g, concurrence_involution)
    >>> k, m
    ([-1.0 * (Y(0) @ X(1)), -1.0 * (X(0) @ Y(1))],
     [X(0) @ X(1), Z(0), Z(1), -1.0 * (Y(0) @ Y(1))])

    We can check the validity of the decomposition using :func:`~check_cartan_decomp`.

    >>> check_cartan_decomp(k, m)
    True

    There are other Cartan decomposition induced by other involutions. For example using :func:`~even_odd_involution`.

    >>> from pennylane.labs.dla import check_cartan_decomp
    >>> k, m = cartan_decomp(g, even_odd_involution)
    >>> k, m

def recursive_cartan_decomp(g, chain, validate=True, verbose=True):
    r"""Apply a recursive Cartan decomposition specified by a chain of decomposition types.
    The decompositions will use canonical involutions and hardcoded basis transformations
    between them in order to obtain a valid recursion.

    This function tries to make sure that only sensible involution sequences are applied,
    and to raise an error otherwise. However, the involutions still need to be configured
    properly, regarding the wires their conjugation operators act on.

    Args:
        g (tensor_like): Basis of the algebra to be decomposed.
        chain (Iterable[Callable]): Sequence of involutions. Each callable should be
            one of
            :func:`~.pennylane.labs.dla.AI`,
            :func:`~.pennylane.labs.dla.AII`,
            :func:`~.pennylane.labs.dla.AIII`,
            :func:`~.pennylane.labs.dla.BDI`,
            :func:`~.pennylane.labs.dla.CI
            :func:`~.pennylane.labs.dla.CII`,
            :func:`~.pennylane.labs.dla.DIII`, or
            :func:`~.pennylane.labs.dla.ClassB`,
            or a partial evolution thereof.
        validate (bool): Whether or not to verify that the involutions return a subalgebra.
        verbose (bool): Whether of not to print status updates during the computation.

    Returns:
        dict: The decompositions at each level. The keys are (zero-based) integers for the
        different levels of the recursion, the values are tuples ``(k, m)`` with subalgebra
        ``k`` and horizontal space ``m``. For each level, ``k`` and ``m`` combine into
        ``k`` from the previous recursion level.

    **Examples**

    Let's set up the special unitary algebra on 2 qubits. Note that we are using the Hermitian
    matrices that correspond to the skew-Hermitian algebra elements via multiplication
    by :math:`i`. Also note that :func:`~.pauli.pauli_group` returns the identity as first
    element, which is not part of the special unitary algebra of traceless matrices.

    >>> g = [qml.matrix(op, wire_order=range(2)) for op in qml.pauli.pauli_group(2)] # u(4)
    >>> g = g[1:] # Remove identity: u(4) -> su(4)

    Now we can apply Cartan decompositions of type AI and DIII in sequence:

    >>> from pennylane.labs.dla import recursive_cartan_decomp, AI, DIII
    >>> chain = [AI, DIII]
    >>> decompositions = recursive_cartan_decomp(g, chain)
    Iteration 0:   15 -----AI---->    6,   9
    Iteration 1:    6 ----DIII--->    4,   2

    The function prints progress of the decompositions by default, which can be deactivated by
    setting ``verbose=False``. Here we see how the initial :math:`\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{su(4)}`
    was decomposed by AI into the six-dimensional :math:`\mathfrak{k}_1=\mathfrak{so(4)}` and a
    horizontal space of dimension nine. Then, :math:`\mathfrak{k}_1` was further decomposed
    by the DIII decomposition into the four-dimensional :math:`\mathfrak{k}_2=\mathfrak{u}(2)`
    and a two-dimensional horizontal space.

    In a more elaborate example, let's apply a chain of decompositions AII, CI, AI, BDI, and DIII
    to the four-qubit unitary algebra. While we took care of the global phase term of :math:`u(4)`
    explicitly above, we leave it in the algebra here, and see that it does not cause problems.
    We discuss the ``wire`` keyword argument below.

    >>> from pennylane.labs.dla import AII, CI, BDI, ClassB
    >>> from functools import partial
    >>> chain = [
    ...     AII,
    ...     CI,
    ...     AI,
    ...     partial(BDI, wire=1),
    ...     partial(ClassB, wire=1),
    ...     partial(DIII, wire=2),
    ... ]
    >>> g = [qml.matrix(op, wire_order=range(4)) for op in qml.pauli.pauli_group(4)] # u(16)
    >>> decompositions = recursive_cartan_decomp(g, chain)
    Iteration 0:  256 ----AII---->  136, 120
    Iteration 1:  136 -----CI---->   64,  72
    Iteration 2:   64 -----AI---->   28,  36
    Iteration 3:   28 ----BDI---->   12,  16
    Iteration 4:   12 ---ClassB-->    6,   6
    Iteration 5:    6 ----DIII--->    4,   2

    The obtained chain of algebras is

    .. math::

        \mathfrak{u}(16)
        \rightarrow \mathfrak{sp}(8)
        \rightarrow \mathfrak{u}(8)
        \rightarrow \mathfrak{so}(8)
        \rightarrow \mathfrak{so}(4) \oplus \mathfrak{so}(4)
        \rightarrow \mathfrak{so}(4)
        \rightarrow \mathfrak{u}(2).

    What about the wire keyword argument to the used involutions?
    A good rule of thumb is that it should start at ``0`` and increment by one every second
    involution. For the involution :func:`~.pennylane.labs.dla.CI` it should additionally be
    increased by one. As ``0`` is the default for ``wire``, it usually does not have to be
    provided explicitly for the first two involutions, unless ``CI`` is among them.

    .. note::

        A typical effect of setting the wire wrongly is that the decomposition does not
        split the subalgebra from the previous step but keeps it intact and returns a
        zero-dimensional horizontal space. For example:

        >>> g = [qml.matrix(op, wire_order=range(2)) for op in qml.pauli.pauli_group(2)] # u(4)
        >>> chain = [AI, DIII, AII]
        >>> decompositions = recursive_cartan_decomp(g, chain)
        Iteration 0:   16 -----AI---->    6,  10
        Iteration 1:    6 ----DIII--->    4,   2
        Iteration 2:    4 ----AII---->    4,   0

        We see that the ``AII`` decomposition did not further decompose :math:`\mathfrak{u}(2)`.
        It works if we provide the correct ``wire`` argument:

        >>> chain = [AI, DIII, partial(AII, wire=1)]
        >>> decompositions = recursive_cartan_decomp(g, chain)
        Iteration 0:   16 -----AI---->    6,  10
        Iteration 1:    6 ----DIII--->    4,   2
        Iteration 2:    4 ----AII---->    3,   1

        We obtain :math:`\mathfrak{sp}(1)` as expected from the decomposition of type AII.
