class ResourceOutOfPlaceSquare(ResourceOperator):
    r"""Resource class for the OutofPlaceSquare gate.

    This operation takes two quantum registers. The input register is of size :code:`register_size`
    and the output register of size :code:`2 * register_size`. The number encoded in the input is
    squared and returned in the output register.

    Args:
        register_size (int): the size of the input register
        wires (Sequence[int], optional): the wires the operation acts on

    Resources:
        The resources are obtained from appendix G, lemma 7 in `PRX Quantum, 2, 040332 (2021)

        the resources are given as :math:`(n - 1)^2` Toffoli gates, and :math:`n` CNOT gates.

    **Example**

    The resources for this operation are computed using:

            clean (bool, optional): Determine if allocated qubits should be reset after the computation

        Resources:
            The resources for QROM are taken from the following two papers:
            `Low et al. (2024) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00954>`_ (Figure 1.C) for
            :code:`clean = False` and `Berry et al. (2019) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02134>`_
            (Figure 4) for :code:`clean = True`.

            Note: we use the single-controlled unary iterator trick to implement the Select. This
            implementation assumes we have access to :math:`n - 1` additional work qubits,
            where :math:`n = \ceil{log_{2}(N)}` and :math:`N` is the number of batches of
            unitaries to select.

            list[GateCount]: A list of GateCount objects, where each object
            represents a specific quantum gate and the number of times it appears
            in the decomposition.
