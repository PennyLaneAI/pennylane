class ResourceIntegerComparator(ResourceOperator):

    This operation provides the cost for comparing basis state, `x`, and a fixed positive integer, val.
    It flips a target qubit if :math:`x \geq val` or :math:`x < val`, depending on the parameter geq.

    Args:
        val (int): the integer to be compared against
        register_size (int): size of the register for basis state
        geq (bool): If set to ``True``, the comparison made will be :math:`x \geq val`. If
            ``False``, the comparison made will be :math:`x < val`.
        wires (Sequence[int], optional): the wires the operation acts on

    Resources:
        This decomposition uses the minimum number of ``MultiControlledX`` gates.
        The given integer is first converted into its binary representation, and the decomposition proceeds by
        iteratively examining significant prefixes of this binary representation.
        For example, when geq is `False`, val is 22 (Binary 010110), and num_wires is 6:

        - Initial Prefix: For all 6-bit number where the first two control qubits are in the 00 state, the
          flipping condition is always `True`, a ``MultiControlledX`` gate can be applied with the first two wires as
          controls and 2 control values.
        - Next Prefix: Subsequently, the next significant bit prefix is examined. The target value 22 begins with 0101.
        - Therefore, all 6-bit numbers begining with 0100 will satisfy the condition, so a ``MultiControlledX`` gate can
          be applied with the first four wires as controls and 0100 as control values.
        - This iterative procedure continues, with MultiControlledX gates being added for each significant bit prefix of
          the target value, until the full conditional operation is realized with the minimum number of multi-controlled operations.
