class ResourceControlledPhaseShift(ResourceOperator):
    r"""Resource class for the ControlledPhaseShift gate.

    Args:
        wires (Sequence[int], optional): the wire the operation acts on
        eps (float, optional): The error threshold for clifford plus T decomposition of the rotation gate.
            The default value is `None` which corresponds to using the epsilon stated in the config.

    Resources:
        The resources are derived using the fact that a :class:`~.ResourcePhaseShift` gate is
        identical to the :class:`~.ResourceRZ` gate up to some global phase. Furthermore, a controlled
        global phase simplifies to a :class:`~.ResourcePhaseShift` gate. This gives rise to the
        following identity:

        .. math:: CR_\phi(\phi) = (R_\phi(\phi/2) \otimes I) \cdot CNOT \cdot (I \otimes R_\phi(-\phi/2)) \cdot CNOT \cdot (I \otimes R_\phi(\phi/2))

        Specifically, the resources are defined as two :class:`~.ResourceCNOT` gates and three
        :class:`~.ResourceRZ` gates.

    .. seealso:: :class:`~.ControlledPhaseShift`
