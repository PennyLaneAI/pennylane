class ResourceAdjoint(ResourceOperator):
    r"""Resource class for the symbolic Adjoint operation.

    A symbolic class used to represent the adjoint of some base operation.

    Args:
        base_op (~.pennylane.labs.resource_estimation.ResourceOperator): The operator that we
            want the adjoint of.
        wires (Sequence[int], optional): the wires the operation acts on

    Resources:
        This symbolic operation represents the adjoint of some base operation. The resources are
        determined as follows. If the base operation implements the
        :code:`.default_adjoint_resource_decomp()` method, then the resources are obtained from
        this.

        Otherwise, the adjoint resources are given as the adjoint of each operation in the
        base operation's resources.

    .. seealso:: :class:`~.ops.op_math.adjoint.AdjointOperation`

    **Example**

    The adjoint operation can be constructed like this:

    >>> qft = plre.ResourceQFT(num_wires=3)
    >>> adj_qft = plre.ResourceAdjoint(qft)

    We can see how the resources differ by choosing a suitable gateset and estimating resources:

    ...     "Adjoint(SWAP)",
    ...     "Hadamard",

class ResourcePow(ResourceOperator):
    r"""Resource class for the symbolic Pow operation.

    A symbolic class used to represent some base operation raised to a power.

    Args:
        base_op (~.pennylane.labs.resource_estimation.ResourceOperator): The operator that we
            want to exponentiate.
        z (float): the exponent (default value is 1)
        wires (Sequence[int], optional): the wires the operation acts on

    Resources:
        The resources are determined as follows. If the power :math:`z = 0`, then we have the identitiy
        gate and we have no resources. If the base operation class :code:`base_class` implements the
        :code:`.pow_resource_decomp()` method, then the resources are obtained from this. Otherwise,
        the resources of the operation raised to the power :math:`z` are given by extracting the base
        operation's resources (via :code:`.resources()`) and raising each operation to the same power.

    .. seealso:: :class:`~.ops.op_math.pow.PowOperation`

    **Example**

    The operation raised to a power :math:`z` can be constructed like this:

    >>> z = plre.ResourceZ()
    >>> z_2 = plre.ResourcePow(z, 2)
    >>> z_5 = plre.ResourcePow(z, 5)

    We obtain the expected resources.

        Resources:
            This symbolic class represents a product of the three provided operations. The resources are
            defined trivially as the sum of the costs of each.

        .. seealso:: :class:`~.ops.op_math.prod.Prod`

        **Example**

        Note, each operation in the product must be a valid :class:`~.pennylane.labs.resource_estimation.ResourceOperator`
        The change of basis operation can be constructed as follows:

        >>> compute_u = plre.ResourceS()
        >>> base_v = plre.ResourceZ()
        >>> cb_op = plre.ResourceChangeBasisOp(compute_u, base_v)
        >>> print(plre.estimate_resources(cb_op, gate_set={"Z", "S", "Adjoint(S)"}))
        --- Resources: ---
        Total qubits: 1
        Total gates : 3
        Qubit breakdown:
        clean qubits: 0, dirty qubits: 0, algorithmic qubits: 1
        Gate breakdown:
        {'S': 1, 'Z': 1, 'Adjoint(S)': 1}

        We can also set the :code:`uncompute_op` directly.

        >>> uncompute_u = plre.ResourceProd([plre.ResourceZ(), plre.ResourceS()])
        >>> cb_op = plre.ResourceChangeBasisOp(compute_u, base_v, uncompute_u)
        >>> print(plre.estimate_resources(cb_op, gate_set={"Z", "S", "Adjoint(S)"}))
