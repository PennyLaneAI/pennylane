        Args:
            ctrl_num_ctrl_wires (int): the number of qubits the operation is controlled on
            ctrl_num_ctrl_values (int): the number of control qubits, that are controlled when in the :math:`|0\rangle` state

        Resources:
            For one or two control wires, the cost is one of :class:`~.ResourceCZ`
            or :class:`~.ResourceCCZ` respectively. Two additional :class:`~.ResourceX` gates
            per control qubit are used to flip the control qubits if they are zero-controlled.
            In the case where multiple controlled wires are provided, the resources are derived from
            the following identity:

            .. math:: \hat{Z} = \hat{H} \cdot \hat{X} \cdot \hat{H}.

            Specifically, the resources are given by a :class:`~.ResourceX` gate conjugated with
            a pair of :class:`~.ResourceHadamard` gates. By replacing the :class:`~.ResourceX` gate
            with a :class:`~.ResourceMultiControlledX` gate, we obtain a controlled-version of this
            identity.
