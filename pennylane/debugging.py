def snapshots(qnode):
    r"""Create a function that retrieves snapshot results from a QNode.

    Args:
        qnode (.QNode): the input QNode to be simulated

    Returns:
        A function that has the same argument signature as ``qnode`` and returns a dictionary.
        When called, the function will execute the QNode on the registered device and retrieve
        the saved snapshots obtained via the :class:`~.pennylane.Snapshot` operation. Additionally,
        the snapshot dictionary always contains the execution results of the QNode, so the use of
        the tag "execution_results" should be avoided to prevent conflicting key names.
