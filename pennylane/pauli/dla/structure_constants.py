    Compute the structure constants that make up the adjoint representation of a Lie algebra.

    .. warning:: :func:`~structure_constants` has moved to the :mod:`pennylane.liealg` module and can be called from there via ``qml.liealg.structure_constants`` or from the top level via ``qml.structure_constants``.

    Given a DLA :math:`\{iG_1, iG_2, .. iG_d \}` of dimension :math:`d`,
    the structure constants yield the decomposition of all commutators in terms of DLA elements,

    .. math:: [i G_\alpha, i G_\beta] = \sum_{\gamma = 0}^{d-1} f^\gamma_{\alpha, \beta} iG_\gamma.

    The adjoint representation :math:`\left(\text{ad}(iG_\gamma)\right)_{\alpha, \beta} = f^\gamma_{\alpha, \beta}` is given by those structure constants,
    which can be computed via

    .. math:: f^\gamma_{\alpha, \beta} = \frac{\text{tr}\left(i G_\gamma \cdot \left[i G_\alpha, i G_\beta \right] \right)}{\text{tr}\left( iG_\gamma iG_\gamma \right)}.

    The inputs are assumed to be orthogonal unless ``is_orthogonal`` is set to ``False``.
    However, we neither assume nor enforce normalization of the DLA elements :math:`G_\alpha`.

    Args:
        g (List[Union[Operator, PauliWord, PauliSentence]]): The (dynamical) Lie algebra for which we want to compute
            its adjoint representation. DLAs can be generated by a set of generators via :func:`~lie_closure`.
        pauli (bool): Indicates whether it is assumed that :class:`~.PauliSentence` or :class:`~.PauliWord` instances are input.
            This can help with performance to avoid unnecessary conversions to :class:`~pennylane.operation.Operator`
            and vice versa. Default is ``False``.
        matrix (bool): Whether or not matrix representations are used in the structure constants computation. This can help speed up the computation when using sums of Paulis with many terms. Default is ``False``.
        is_orthogonal (bool): Whether the set of operators in ``g`` is orthogonal with respect to the trace inner product.
            Default is ``True``.

    Returns:
        TensorLike: The adjoint representation of shape ``(d, d, d)``, corresponding to indices ``(gamma, alpha, beta)``.

    **Example**

    Let us generate the DLA of the transverse field Ising model using :func:`~lie_closure`.

    >>> n = 2
    >>> gens = [X(i) @ X(i+1) for i in range(n-1)]
    >>> gens += [Z(i) for i in range(n)]
    >>> dla = qml.lie_closure(gens)
    >>> print(dla)
    [X(0) @ X(1), Z(0), Z(1), -1.0 * (Y(0) @ X(1)), -1.0 * (X(0) @ Y(1)), -1.0 * (Y(0) @ Y(1))]

    The dimension of the DLA is :math:`d = 6`. Hence, the structure constants have shape ``(6, 6, 6)``.

    >>> adjoint_rep = qml.structure_constants(dla)
    >>> adjoint_rep.shape
    (6, 6, 6)

    The structure constants tell us the commutation relation between operators in the DLA via

    .. math:: [i G_\alpha, i G_\beta] = \sum_{\gamma = 0}^{d-1} f^\gamma_{\alpha, \beta} iG_\gamma.

    Let us confirm those with an example. Take :math:`[iG_1, iG_3] = [iZ_0, -iY_0 X_1] = -i 2 X_0 X_1 = -i 2 G_0`, so
    we should have :math:`f^0_{1, 3} = -2`, which is indeed the case.

    >>> adjoint_rep[0, 1, 3]
    -2.0

    We can also look at the overall adjoint action of the first element :math:`G_0 = X_{0} \otimes X_{1}` of the DLA on other elements.
    In particular, at :math:`\left(\text{ad}(iG_0)\right)_{\alpha, \beta} = f^0_{\alpha, \beta}`, which corresponds to the following matrix.

    >>> adjoint_rep[0]
    array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [-0.,  0.,  0., -2.,  0.,  0.],
           [-0.,  0.,  0.,  0., -2.,  0.],
           [-0.,  2., -0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [-0., -0.,  2.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0., -0., -0., -0., -0.,  0.]])

    Note that we neither enforce nor assume normalization by default.

    To compute the structure constants of a non-orthogonal set of operators, use the option
    ``is_orthogonal=False``:

    >>> dla = [qml.X(0), qml.Y(0), qml.X(0) - qml.Z(0)]
    >>> adjoint_rep = qml.structure_constants(dla, is_orthogonal=False)
    >>> adjoint_rep[:, 0, 1] # commutator of X_0 and Y_0 consists of first and last operator
    array([-2.,  0.,  2.])

    We can also use matrix representations for the computation, which is sometimes faster, in particular for sums of many Pauli words.
    This only affects how the structure constants are computed internally, it does not change the result.

    >>> adjoint_rep2 = qml.structure_constants(dla, is_orthogonal=False, matrix=True)
    >>> qml.math.allclose(adjoint_rep, adjoint_rep2)
    True

    We can also input the DLA as a list of matrices. For that we use :func:`~lie_closure` with ``matrix=True``.

    >>> n = 4
    >>> gens = [qml.X(i) @ qml.X(i+1) + qml.Y(i) @ qml.Y(i+1) + qml.Z(i) @ qml.Z(i+1) for i in range(n-1)]
    >>> g = qml.lie_closure(gens, matrix=True)
    >>> g.shape
    (12, 16, 16)

    The DLA is represented by a collection of twelve :math:`2^4 \times 2^4` matrices.
    Hence, the dimension of the DLA is :math:`d = 12` and the structure constants have shape ``(12, 12, 12)``.

    >>> adj = qml.structure_constants(g, matrix=True)
    >>> adj.shape
    (12, 12, 12)

    .. details::
        :title: Mathematical details

        Consider a (dynamical) Lie algebra :math:`\{iG_1, iG_2, .. iG_d \}` of dimension :math:`d`.
        The defining property of the structure constants is that they express the decomposition
        of commutators in terms of the DLA elements, as described at the top. This can be written
        as

        .. math::
            [i G_\alpha, i G_\beta] = \sum_{\gamma = 0}^{d-1} f^\gamma_{\alpha, \beta} iG_\gamma.

        Now we may multiply this equation with the adjoint of a DLA element and apply the trace:

        .. math::

            \text{tr}\left(-i G_\eta \cdot \left[i G_\alpha, i G_\beta \right] \right)
            &= \text{tr}\left(-i G_\eta
            \sum_{\gamma = 0}^{d-1} f^\gamma_{\alpha, \beta} iG_\gamma\right)\\
            &= \sum_{\gamma = 0}^{d-1} \underset{g_{\eta \gamma}}{\underbrace{
            \text{tr}\left(-i G_\eta iG_\gamma\right)}}
            f^\gamma_{\alpha, \beta} \\
            \Rightarrow\ f^\gamma_{\alpha, \beta} &= (g^{-1})_{\gamma \eta}
            \text{tr}\left(-i G_\eta \cdot \left[i G_\alpha, i G_\beta \right] \right).

        Here we introduced the Gram matrix
        :math:`g_{\alpha\beta} = \text{tr}(-iG_\alpha i G_\beta)` of the DLA elements.
        Note that this is just the projection of the commutator on the DLA element
        :math:`iG_\gamma` via the trace inner product.

        Now, if the DLA elements are orthogonal, as assumed by ``structure_constants`` by default,
        the Gram matrix will be diagonal and simply consist of some rescaling factors, so that the
        above computation becomes the equation from the very top:

        .. math::
            f^\gamma_{\alpha, \beta} =
            \frac{\text{tr}\left(i G_\gamma \cdot \left[i G_\alpha, i G_\beta \right] \right)}
            {\text{tr}\left( iG_\gamma iG_\gamma \right)}.

        This is cheaper than computing the full Gram matrix, inverting it, and multiplying it to
        the trace inner products.

        For the case of an orthonormal set of operators, we even have
        :math:`g_{\alpha\beta}=\delta_{\alpha\beta}`, so that the division in this calculation can
        be skipped.
