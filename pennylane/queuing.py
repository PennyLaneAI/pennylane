This module contains the classes for placing objects into queues.

Description
-----------

Users provide *quantum functions* which PennyLane needs to convert into a circuit representation capable
of being executed by a device. A quantum function is any callable that:

* accepts classical inputs
* constructs any number of quantum :class:`~.Operator` objects
* returns one or more :class:`~.MeasurementProcess` objects.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    def qfunc(x, scale_value=1):
        qml.RX(x * scale_value, wires=0)
        if (1 != 2):
            qml.S(0)
        return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0)), qml.expval(qml.PauliX(1))

To convert from a quantum function to a representation of a circuit, we use queuing.

A *queuable object* is anything that can be placed into a queue. These will be :class:`~.Operator`,
:class:`~.MeasurementProcess`, and :class:`~.QuantumTape` objects. :class:`~.Operator` and
:class:`~.MeasurementProcess` objects achieve queuing via a :meth:`~.Operator.queue` method called upon construction.
Note that even though :class:`~.QuantumTape` is a queuable object, it does not have a ``queue`` method.

When an object is queued, it sends itself to the :class:`~.QueuingManager`. The :class:`~.QueuingManager`
is a global singleton class that facilitates placing objects in the queue. All of :class:`~.QueuingManager`'s methods
and properties are class methods and properties, so all instances will access the same information.

The :meth:`~.QueuingManager.active_context` is the queue where any new objects are placed.
The :class:`~.QueuingManager` is said to be *recording* if an active context exists.

Active contexts are :class:`~.AnnotatedQueue` instances. They are *context managers* where recording occurs
within a ``with`` block.

Let's take a look at an example. If we query the :class:`~.QueuingManager` outside of an
:class:`~.AnnotatedQueue`'s context, we can see that nothing is recording and no active context exists.

>>> print("Are we recording? ", qml.QueuingManager.recording())
Are we recording?  False
>>> print("What's the active context? ", qml.QueuingManager.active_context())
What's the active context?  None

Inside of a context, we can see the active recording context:

>>> with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
...     print("Are we recording? ", qml.QueuingManager.recording())
...     print("Is q the active queue? ", q is qml.QueuingManager.active_context())
Are we recording?  True
Is q the active queue?  True

If we have nested :class:`~.AnnotatedQueue` contexts, only the innermost one will be recording.
Once the currently active queue exits, any outer queue will resume recording.

>>> with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q1:
...     print("Is q1 recording? ", q1 is qml.QueuingManager.active_context())
...     with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q2:
...         print("Is q1 recording? ", q1 is qml.QueuingManager.active_context())
...     print("Is q1 recording? ", q1 is qml.QueuingManager.active_context())
Is q1 recording?  True
Is q1 recording?  False
Is q1 recording?  True

If we construct an operator inside the recording context, we can see it is added to the queue:

>>> with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
...     op = qml.PauliX(0)
>>> q.queue
[PauliX(wires=[0])]

If an operator is constructed outside of the context, we can manually add it to the queue by
calling the :meth:`~.Operator.queue` method. The :meth:`~.Operator.queue` method is automatically
called upon initialization, but it can also be manually called at a later time.

>>> op = qml.PauliX(0)
>>> with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
...     op.queue()
>>> q.queue
[PauliX(wires=[0])]

An object can only exist up to *once* in the queue, so calling queue multiple times will
not do anything.

>>> op = qml.PauliX(0)
>>> with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
...     op.queue()
...     op.queue()
>>> q.queue
[PauliX(wires=[0])]

The :func:`~.apply` method allows a single object to be queued multiple times in a circuit.
The function queues a copy of the original object if it already in the queue.

>>> op = qml.PauliX(0)
>>> with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
...     qml.apply(op)
...     qml.apply(op)
>>> q.queue
[PauliX(wires=[0]), PauliX(wires=[0])]
>>> q.queue[0] is q.queue[1]
False

In the case of operators composed of other operators, like with :class:`~.SymbolicOp` and
:class:`~.CompositeOp`, the new nested operation removes its constituents from the queue.
Only the operators that will end up in the circuit will remain.

>>> with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
...     base = qml.PauliX(0)
...     print(q.queue)
...     pow_op = base ** 1.5
...     print(q.queue)
[PauliX(wires=[0])]
[PauliX(wires=[0])**1.5]

Once the queue is constructed, the :func:`~.process_queue` function converts it into the operations
and measurements in the final circuit. This step eliminates any object that has an owner.

>>> with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
...     qml.StatePrep(np.array([1.0, 0]), wires=0)
...     base = qml.PauliX(0)
...     pow_op = base ** 1.5
...     qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliX(1))
>>> ops, measurements = qml.queuing.process_queue(q)
>>> ops
[StatePrep(tensor([1., 0.], requires_grad=True), wires=[0]), PauliX(wires=[0])**1.5]
>>> measurements
[expval(PauliZ(wires=[0]) @ PauliX(wires=[1]))]

These lists can be used to construct a :class:`~.QuantumScript`:

>>> qml.tape.QuantumScript(ops, measurements)
<QuantumScript: wires=[0, 1], params=1>

In order to construct new operators within a recording, but without queuing them
use the :meth:`~.queuing.QueuingManager.stop_recording` context upon construction:

>>> with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
...     with qml.QueuingManager.stop_recording():
...         qml.PauliY(1)
>>> q.queue
[]

            applied to the currently active queuing context.
    Returns:
        .Operator or .MeasurementProcess: the input operator is returned for convenience

    **Example**

    In PennyLane, **operations and measurements are 'queued' or added to a circuit
    when they are instantiated**.

    The ``apply`` function can be used to add operations that might have
    already been instantiated elsewhere to the QNode:

    .. code-block:: python

        op = qml.RX(0.4, wires=0)
        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x):
            qml.RY(x, wires=0)  # applied during instantiation
            qml.apply(op)  # manually applied
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)(0.6))
    0: ──RY(0.6)──RX(0.4)──┤ ⟨Z⟩

    It can also be used to apply functions repeatedly:

    .. code-block:: python

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x):
            qml.apply(op)
            qml.RY(x, wires=0)
            qml.apply(op)
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)(0.6))
    0: ──RX(0.4)──RY(0.6)──RX(0.4)──┤ ⟨Z⟩

    .. warning::

        If you use ``apply`` on an operator that has already been queued, it will
        be queued for a second time. For example:

        .. code-block:: python

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit():
                op = qml.Hadamard(0)
                qml.apply(op)
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

        >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())
        0: ──H──H─┤  <Z>

    .. details::
        :title: Usage Details

        Instantiated measurements can also be applied to queuing contexts
        using ``apply``:

        .. code-block:: python

            meas = qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliY(1))
            dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(x):
                qml.RY(x, wires=0)
                qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
                return qml.apply(meas)

        >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)(0.6))
         0: ──RY(0.6)──╭●──╭┤ ⟨Z ⊗ Y⟩
         1: ───────────╰X──╰┤ ⟨Z ⊗ Y⟩

        By default, ``apply`` will queue operators to the currently
        active queuing context.

        When working with low-level queuing contexts such as quantum tapes,
        the desired context to queue the operation to can be explicitly
        passed:

        .. code-block:: python

            with qml.tape.QuantumTape() as tape1:
                qml.Hadamard(wires=1)

                with qml.tape.QuantumTape() as tape2:
                    # Due to the nesting behaviour of queuing contexts,
                    # tape2 will be queued to tape1.

                    # The following PauliX operation will be queued
                    # to the active queuing context, tape2, during instantiation.
                    op1 = qml.PauliX(wires=0)

                    # We can use qml.apply to apply the same operation to tape1
                    # without leaving the tape2 context.
                    qml.apply(op1, context=tape1)
