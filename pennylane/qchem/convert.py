def _process_wires(wires, n_wires=None):
    r"""Checks and consolidates custom user wire mapping into a consistent, direction-free, ``Wires``
    format. Used for converting between OpenFermion qubit numbering and PennyLane wire labels.

    Since OpenFermion's qubit numbering is always consecutive int, simple iterable types such as
    list, tuple, or Wires can be used to specify the 2-way `qubit index` <-> `wire label` mapping
    with indices representing qubits. Dict can also be used as a mapping, but does not provide any
    advantage over lists other than the ability to do partial mapping/permutation in the
    `qubit index` -> `wire label` direction.

    It is recommended to pass Wires/list/tuple `wires` since it's direction-free, i.e. the same
    `wires` argument can be used to convert both ways between OpenFermion and PennyLane. Only use
    dict for partial or unordered mapping.

    Args:
        wires (Wires, list, tuple, dict): User wire labels.
            For types Wires, list, or tuple, each item in the iterable represents a wire label
            corresponding to the qubit number equal to its index.
            For type dict, only int-keyed dict (for qubit-to-wire conversion) or
            consecutive-int-valued dict (for wire-to-qubit conversion) is accepted.
            If None, will be set to consecutive int based on ``n_wires``.
        n_wires (int): Number of wires used if known. If None, will be inferred from ``wires``; if
            ``wires`` is not available, will be set to 1.

    Returns:
        Wires: Cleaned wire mapping with indices corresponding to qubits and values
            corresponding to wire labels.

    **Example**

    >>> # consec int wires if no wires mapping provided, ie. identity map: 0<->0, 1<->1, 2<->2
    >>> _process_wires(None, 3)
    <Wires = [0, 1, 2]>
