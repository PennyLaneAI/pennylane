def _process_wires(wires, n_wires=None):
    r"""Checks and consolidates custom user wire mapping into a consistent, direction-free, ``Wires``
    format. Used for converting between OpenFermion qubit numbering and PennyLane wire labels.

    Since OpenFermion's qubit numbering is always consecutive int, simple iterable types such as
    list, tuple, or Wires can be used to specify the 2-way `qubit index` <-> `wire label` mapping
    with indices representing qubits. Dict can also be used as a mapping, but does not provide any
    advantage over lists other than the ability to do partial mapping/permutation in the
    `qubit index` -> `wire label` direction.

    It is recommended to pass Wires/list/tuple `wires` since it's direction-free, i.e. the same
    `wires` argument can be used to convert both ways between OpenFermion and PennyLane. Only use
    dict for partial or unordered mapping.

    Args:
        wires (Wires, list, tuple, dict): User wire labels.
            For types Wires, list, or tuple, each item in the iterable represents a wire label
            corresponding to the qubit number equal to its index.
            For type dict, only int-keyed dict (for qubit-to-wire conversion) or
            consecutive-int-valued dict (for wire-to-qubit conversion) is accepted.
            If None, will be set to consecutive int based on ``n_wires``.
        n_wires (int): Number of wires used if known. If None, will be inferred from ``wires``; if
            ``wires`` is not available, will be set to 1.

    Returns:
        Wires: Cleaned wire mapping with indices corresponding to qubits and values
            corresponding to wire labels.

    >>> # consec int wires if no wires mapping provided, ie. identity map: 0<->0, 1<->1, 2<->2

    corresponds to a Slater determinant, and the values are the CI coefficients of the Slater
    determinant. Each dictionary key is a tuple of two integers. The binary representation of these
    integers correspond to a specific configuration: the first number represents the
    configuration of the alpha electrons and the second number represents the configuration of the
    beta electrons. For instance, the Hartree-Fock state :math:`|1 1 0 0 \rangle` will be
    represented by the flipped binary string ``0011`` which is split to ``01`` and ``01`` for
    the alpha and beta electrons. The integer corresponding to ``01`` is ``1`` and the dictionary
    representation of the Hartree-Fock state will be ``{(1, 1): 1.0}``. The dictionary
    representation of a state with ``0.99`` contribution from the Hartree-Fock state and ``0.01``
    contribution from the doubly-excited state, i.e., :math:`|0 0 1 1 \rangle`, will be
    ``{(1, 1): 0.99, (2, 2): 0.01}``.

    In the current version, the exponential ansatz :math:`\exp(\hat{T}_1 + \hat{T}_2) \ket{\text{HF}}`
    is expanded to second order, with only single and double excitation terms collected and kept.
    In the future this will be amended to also collect terms from higher order. The expansion gives

    .. math::
        \exp(\hat{T}_1 + \hat{T}_2) \ket{\text{HF}} = \left[ 1 + \hat{T}_1 +
                                    \left( \hat{T}_2 + 0.5 * \hat{T}_1^2 \right) \right] \ket{\text{HF}}

    The coefficients in this expansion are the CI coefficients used to build the wavefunction
    representation.

    Args:
        ccsd_solver (PySCF UCCSD Class instance): the class object representing the UCCSD calculation in PySCF
        tol (float): the tolerance for discarding Slater determinants with small coefficients

    Returns:

        having binary represention corresponding to the Fock occupation vector in alpha and beta
        spin sectors, respectively, and coeff being the CI coefficients of those configurations
