def template(func):
    """Register a quantum template with PennyLane.

    This decorator wraps the given function and makes it return a list of all queued Operations.

    **Example:**

    When defining a :doc:`template </introduction/templates>`, simply decorate
    the template function with this decorator.

    .. code-block:: python3

        @qml.template
        def bell_state_preparation(wires):
            qml.Hadamard(wires=wires[0])
            qml.CNOT(wires=wires)

    This registers the template with PennyLane, making it compatible with
    functions that act on templates, such as :func:`pennylane.inv`:

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=2)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit():
            qml.inv(bell_state_preparation(wires=[0, 1]))
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1))

    Args:
        func (callable): A template function

    Returns:
        callable: The wrapper function

            recorder_class = qml.tape.TapeOperationRecorder
