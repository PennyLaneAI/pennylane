    r"""An operation representing the QDrift approximation for the complex matrix exponential
    of a given Hamiltonian.

    The QDrift subroutine provides a method to approximate the matrix exponential of a Hamiltonian
    expressed as a linear combination of terms which in general do not commute. For the Hamiltonian
    :math:`H = \Sigma_j h_j H_{j}`, the product formula is constructed by random sampling from the
    terms of the Hamiltonian with the probability :math:`p_j = h_j / \sum_{j} hj` as:

    .. math::

        \prod_{j}^{n} e^{i \lambda H_j \tau / n},

    where :math:`\tau` is time, :math:`\lambda = \sum_j |h_j|` and :math:`n` is the total number of
    terms to be sampled and added to the product. Note, the terms :math:`H_{j}` are assumed to be
    normalized such that the "impact" of each term is fully encoded in the magnitude of :math:`h_{j}`.

    The number of samples :math:`n` required for a given error threshold can be approximated by:

    .. math::

        n \ \approx \ \frac{2\lambda^{2}t^{2}}{\epsilon}

    For more details see `Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 070503 (2019) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08017>`_.

    Args:
        hamiltonian (Union[.Hamiltonian, .Sum]): The Hamiltonian written as a sum of operations
        time (float): The time of evolution, namely the parameter :math:`t` in :math:`e^{iHt}`
        n (int): An integer representing the number of exponentiated terms
        seed (int): The seed for the random number generator

    Raises:
        TypeError: The ``hamiltonian`` is not of type :class:`~.Hamiltonian`, or :class:`~.Sum`
        QuantumFunctionError: If the coefficients of ``hamiltonian`` are trainable and are used

        :title: Usage Details

        We currently **Do NOT** support computing gradients with respect to the
        coefficients of the input Hamiltonian. We can however compute the gradient
        with respect to the evolution time:

        .. code-block:: python3

            dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def my_circ(time):
                # Prepare H:
                H = qml.dot([0.2, -0.1], [qml.PauliY(0), qml.PauliZ(1)])

                # Prepare some state
                qml.Hadamard(0)

                # Evolve according to H
                qml.QDrift(H, time, n=10, seed=10)

                # Measure some quantity
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1))


        >>> time = np.array(1.23)
        >>> print(qml.grad(my_circ)(time))
        0.27980654844422853

        The error in the approximation of time evolution with the QDrift protocol is
        directly related to the number of samples used in the product. We provide a
        method to upper-bound the error:

        >>> H = qml.dot([0.25, 0.75], [qml.PauliX(0), qml.PauliZ(0)])
        >>> print(qml.QDrift.error(H, time=1.2, n=10))
