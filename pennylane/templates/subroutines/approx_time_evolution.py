class ApproxTimeEvolution(Operation):
    r"""Applies the Trotterized time-evolution operator for an arbitrary Hamiltonian, expressed in terms
    of Pauli gates.

    .. note::

        We recommend using :class:`~.TrotterProduct` as the more general operation for approximate
        matrix exponentiation. One can recover the behaviour of :class:`~.ApproxTimeEvolution` by
        taking the adjoint:

        >>> qml.adjoint(qml.TrotterProduct(hamiltonian, time, order=1, n=n))

    The general time-evolution operator for a time-independent Hamiltonian is given by

    .. math:: U(t) \ = \ e^{-i H t},

    for some Hamiltonian of the form:

    .. math:: H \ = \ \displaystyle\sum_{j} H_j.

    Implementing this unitary with a set of quantum gates is difficult, as the terms :math:`H_j` don't
    necessarily commute with one another. However, we are able to exploit the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition formula,

    .. math:: e^{A \ + \ B} \ = \ \lim_{n \to \infty} \Big[ e^{A/n} e^{B/n} \Big]^n,

    to implement an approximation of the time-evolution operator as

    .. math:: U \ \approx \ \displaystyle\prod_{k \ = \ 1}^{n} \displaystyle\prod_{j} e^{-i H_j t / n},

    with the approximation becoming better for larger :math:`n`.
    The circuit implementing this unitary is of the form:

    .. figure:: ../../_static/templates/subroutines/approx_time_evolution.png
        :align: center
        :width: 60%
        :target: javascript:void(0);

    It is also important to note that
    this decomposition is exact for any value of :math:`n` when each term of the Hamiltonian
    commutes with every other term.

    .. warning::

        The Trotter-Suzuki decomposition depends on the order of the summed observables. Two mathematically identical :class:`~.Hamiltonian` objects may undergo different time evolutions
        due to the order in which those observables are stored.

    .. note::

       This template uses the :class:`~.PauliRot` operation in order to implement
       exponentiated terms of the input Hamiltonian. This operation only takes
       terms that are explicitly written in terms of products of Pauli matrices (:class:`~.PauliX`,
       :class:`~.PauliY`, :class:`~.PauliZ`, and :class:`~.Identity`).
       Thus, each term in the Hamiltonian must be expressed this way upon input, or else an error will be raised.

    Args:
        hamiltonian (.Hamiltonian): The Hamiltonian defining the
           time-evolution operator.
           The Hamiltonian must be explicitly written
           in terms of products of Pauli gates (:class:`~.PauliX`, :class:`~.PauliY`,
           :class:`~.PauliZ`, and :class:`~.Identity`).
        time (int or float): The time of evolution, namely the parameter :math:`t` in :math:`e^{- i H t}`.
        n (int): The number of Trotter steps used when approximating the time-evolution operator.

    .. seealso:: :class:`~.TrotterProduct`.
