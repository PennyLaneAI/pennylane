    r"""Compute the Walshâ€“Hadamard Transform of a one-dimensional array.

    Args:
        D (tensor_like): The array or tensor to be transformed. Must have a length that
            is a power of two.

    Returns:
        tensor_like: The transformed tensor with the same shape as the input ``D``.

    Due to the execution of the transform as a sequence of tensor multiplications
    with shapes ``(2, 2), (2, 2,... 2)->(2, 2,... 2)``, the theoretical scaling of this
    method is the same as the one for the
    `Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Walsh-Hadamard_transform>`__:
    On ``n`` qubits, there are ``n`` calls to ``tensordot``, each multiplying a
    ``(2, 2)`` matrix to a ``(2,)*n`` vector, with a single axis being contracted. This means
    that there are ``n`` operations with a FLOP count of ``4 * 2**(n-1)``, where ``4`` is the cost
    of a single ``(2, 2) @ (2,)`` contraction and ``2**(n-1)`` is the number of copies due to the
    non-contracted ``n-1`` axes.
    Due to the large internal speedups of compiled matrix multiplication and compatibility
    with autodifferentiation frameworks, the approach taken here is favourable over a manual
    realization of the FWHT unless memory limitations restrict the creation of intermediate
    arrays.
