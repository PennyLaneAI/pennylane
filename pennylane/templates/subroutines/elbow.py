class Elbow(Operation):
    r"""Elbow(wires)

    The Elbow operator is a three-qubit gate analogous to an AND or Toffoli gate that leverages extra information
    in the target wire to enable more efficient circuit decompositions: the ``Elbow`` assumes the target qubit
    is initialized in :math:`|0\rangle`, while the ``Adjoint(Elbow)`` assumes the target output in :math:`|0\rangle`.
    For more details, see `Ryan Babbush et al.(2018), Fig 4 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03662>`_.

    .. note::

        For correct usage of the operator, the user must ensure that the input or output is :math:`|0\rangle`
        on the target wire when using ``Elbow`` or ``Adjoint(Elbow)`` respectively. Otherwise, the behavior could be
        different from the expected AND.

    **Details:**

    * Number of wires: 3
    * Number of parameters: 0

    Args:
        wires (Sequence[int]): the subsystem the gate acts on. The first two wires are the control wires and the
            third one is the target wire.

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", shots=1)
