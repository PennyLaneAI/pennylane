class AllSinglesDoubles(Operation):
    r"""Apply the :class:`~.pennylane.SingleExcitation` and :class:`~.pennylane.DoubleExcitation`
    operations, implemented as Givens rotations, to the :math:`n-`qubit system to prepare the
    correlated quantum state of a molecule.

    This ansatz is similar to the traditional `Unitary Coupled-Clusters Singles
    and Doubles (UCCSD) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04340>`_ given by,

    .. math::

        \hat{U}(\vec{\theta}) =
        \prod_{p > r} \mathrm{exp} \Big\{\theta_{pr}
        (\hat{c}_p^\dagger \hat{c}_r-\mathrm{H.c.}) \Big\}
        \prod_{p > q > r > s} \mathrm{exp} \Big\{\theta_{pqrs}
        (\hat{c}_p^\dagger \hat{c}_q^\dagger \hat{c}_r \hat{c}_s-\mathrm{H.c.}) \Big\}

    where :math:`\hat{c}_p^\dagger \hat{c}_r` and
    :math:`\hat{c}_p^\dagger \hat{c}_q^\dagger \hat{c}_r \hat{c}_s` are, respectively, the
    fermionic single- and double-excitation operators, and the indices :math:`r, s`
    and :math:`p, q` run over the Hartree-Fock occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals.

    The main difference with respect to the original UCCSD template is that the gate
    decompositions used to exponentiate the single- and double-excitation operators
    are replaced with the application of `Givens rotations
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givens_rotation>`_ that act on the subspaces of two and
    four qubits. More specifically, the :class:`~.pennylane.SingleExcitation` operation performs
    a rotation in the two-dimensional subspace :math:`\{\vert 10 \rangle, \vert 01 \rangle \}`
    of the qubits :math:`r, p` associated with the single excitation
    :math:`\hat{c}_p^\dagger \hat{c}_r \vert \mathrm{HF} \rangle` of the Hartree-Fock (HF)
    state. Similarly, the :class:`~.pennylane.DoubleExcitation` operation implements
    a rotation in the subspace :math:`\{\vert 1100 \rangle, \vert 0011 \rangle \}` of the qubits
    :math:`s, r, q, p` involved in the double excitation
    :math:`\hat{c}_p^\dagger \hat{c}_q^\dagger \hat{c}_r \hat{c}_s \vert \mathrm{HF} \rangle`.

    The resulting unitary conserves the number of particles and prepares the
    :math:`n`-qubit system in a superposition of the initial HF state and
    multiple-excited configurations.

    Args:
        weights (tensor_like): Size ``(len(singles) + len(doubles),)`` tensor containing the
            angles :math:`\theta` entering the :class:`~.pennylane.SingleExcitation` and
            :class:`~.pennylane.DoubleExcitation` operations. The indices of the qubits the
            operations act on are generated with the :func:`~.excitations` function.
        wires (Iterable): wires that the template acts on.
        singles (Sequence[Sequence]): sequence of lists containing the wires indices ``[r, p]``
        doubles (Sequence[Sequence]): sequence of lists containing the wires indices
            ``[s, r, q, p]``
        hf_state (array[int]): Length ``len(wires)`` occupation-number vector representing the
            HF state. ``hf_state`` is used to initialize the wires.

    .. UsageDetails::

        Notice that:

        #. The number of wires has to be equal to the number of spin orbitals included in
           the active space.

        #. The single and double excitations can be generated with the function
           :func:`~.excitations`. See example below.

        #. The vector of parameters ``weights`` is a one-dimensional array of size
           ``len(singles)+len(doubles)``

        An example of how to use this template is shown below:
