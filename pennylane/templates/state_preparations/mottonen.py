    uniformly controlled rotation to the rotation angles used in the
    `Gray code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code>`__ implementation.
    This function uses the fact that the transformation given by Eq. (3) in
    `Möttönen et al. (2004) <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407010>`_ is equal to a Walsh-Hadamard
    transform followed by some permutations, which can be expressed as a ladder of CNOT gates
    applied to the angles, when interpreting them as a quantum state.

    Args:
        alpha (tensor_like): The array or tensor to be transformed. Must have a length that
            is a power of two.
        num_qubits (int): Number of qubits. If not given, it will be computed from ``alpha``.
            If given, it should match the trailing dimension of ``alpha``.

    Returns:
        tensor_like: The transformed tensor with the same shape as the input ``alpha``.

    Due to the execution of the transform as a sequence of tensor multiplications
    with shapes ``(2, 2), (2, 2,... 2)->(2, 2,... 2)``, the theoretical scaling of this
    method is the same as the one for the
    `Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Walsh-Hadamard_transform>`__:
    On :math:`n` qubits, there are :math:`n` calls to ``tensordot``, each multiplying a ``(2, 2)``
    matrix to a ``(2,)*num_qubits`` vector, with a single axis being contracted. This means
    that there are :math:`n` operations with a floating point operation count of
    ``4 * 2**(num_qubits-1)``, where ``4`` is the cost of a single ``(2, 2) @ (2,)`` contraction
    and ``2**(n-1)`` is the number of copies due to the non-contracted :math:`n-1` axes.
    Due to the large internal speedups of compiled matrix multiplication and compatibility
    with autodifferentiation frameworks, the approach taken here is favourable over a manual
    realization of the FWHT unless memory limitations restrict the creation of intermediate
    arrays, which would make in-place techniques favourable.

    Similarly, the permutation can be applied by contracting the angles with the reshaped CNOT
    matrix.

    Prepares an arbitrary state on the given wires using a decomposition into gates developed
    by `Möttönen et al. (2004) <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407010>`_.

    The state is prepared via a sequence
    of uniformly controlled rotations. A uniformly controlled rotation on a target qubit is
    composed from all possible controlled rotations on the qubit and can be used to address individual
    elements of the state vector.

    In the work of Möttönen et al., inverse state preparation
    is executed by first equalizing the phases of the state vector via uniformly controlled Z rotations,
    and then rotating the now real state vector into the direction of the state :math:`|0\rangle` via
    uniformly controlled Y rotations.

    This code is adapted from code written by Carsten Blank for PennyLane-Qiskit.
