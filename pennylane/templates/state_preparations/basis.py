def BasisStatePreparation(basis_state, wires):
    r"""
    Prepares a basis state on the given wires using a sequence of Pauli X gates.

    .. warning::

        ``basis_state`` influences the circuit architecture and is therefore incompatible with
        gradient computations. Ensure that ``basis_state`` is not passed to the qnode by positional
        arguments.

    Args:
        basis_state (array): Input array of shape ``(N,)``, where N is the number of wires
            the state preparation acts on. ``N`` must be smaller or equal to the total
            number of wires of the device.
        wires (Iterable or Wires): Wires that the template acts on. Accepts an iterable of numbers or strings, or
            a Wires object.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if inputs do not have the correct format
