class QutritBasisStatePreparation(Operation):
    r"""
    Prepares a basis state on the given wires using a sequence of TShift gates.

    .. warning::

        ``basis_state`` influences the circuit architecture and is therefore incompatible with
        gradient computations.

    Args:
        basis_state (array): Input array of shape ``(n,)``, where n is the number of wires
            the state preparation acts on.
        wires (Iterable): wires that the template acts on
