r"""
This module contains templates for trainable 'layers' of quantum gates.

In contrast to other templates such as embeddings, layers
do typically only take trainable parameters, and get repeated in the circuit -- just like the layers of a
neural network. This makes the layer 'learnable' within the limits of the architecture.

Most templates in this module have a 'Layer' version that implements a single layer, as well as a 'Layers'
version which calls the single layer multiple times, possibly using different hyperparameters for the
sequence in each call.

def Interferometer(theta, phi, varphi, wires, mesh='rectangular', beamsplitter='pennylane'):
    r"""General linear interferometer, an array of beamsplitters and phase shifters.

    For :math:`M` wires, the general interferometer is specified by
    providing :math:`M(M-1)/2` transmittivity angles :math:`\theta` and the same number of
    phase angles :math:`\phi`, as well as either :math:`M-1` or :math:`M` additional rotation
    parameters :math:`\varphi`.

    For the parametrization of a universal interferometer
    :math:`M-1` such rotation parameters are sufficient. If :math:`M` rotation
    parameters are given, the interferometer is over-parametrized, but the resulting
    circuit is more symmetric, which can be advantageous.

    By specifying the keyword argument ``mesh``, the scheme used to implement the interferometer
    may be adjusted:

    * ``mesh='rectangular'`` (default): uses the scheme described in
      :cite:`clements2016optimal`, resulting in a *rectangular* array of
      :math:`M(M-1)/2` beamsplitters arranged in :math:`M` slices and ordered from left
      to right and top to bottom in each slice. The first beamsplitter acts on
      wires :math:`0` and :math:`1`:

      .. figure:: ../_static/clements.png
          :align: center
          :width: 30%
          :target: javascript:void(0);


    * ``mesh='triangular'``: uses the scheme described in :cite:`reck1994experimental`,
      resulting in a *triangular* array of :math:`M(M-1)/2` beamsplitters arranged in
      :math:`2M-3` slices and ordered from left to right and top to bottom. The
      first and fourth beamsplitters act on wires :math:`M-1` and :math:`M`, the second
      on :math:`M-2` and :math:`M-1`, and the third on :math:`M-3` and :math:`M-2`, and
      so on.

      .. figure:: ../_static/reck.png
          :align: center
          :width: 30%
          :target: javascript:void(0);

    In both schemes, the network of :class:`~pennylane.ops.Beamsplitter` operations is followed by
    :math:`M` (or :math:`M-1`) local :class:`~pennylane.ops.Rotation` Operations. In the latter case, the
    rotation on the last wire is left out.

    The rectangular decomposition is generally advantageous, as it has a lower
    circuit depth (:math:`M` vs :math:`2M-3`) and optical depth than the triangular
    decomposition, resulting in reduced optical loss.

    This is an example of a 4-mode interferometer with beamsplitters :math:`B` and rotations :math:`R`,
    using ``mesh='rectangular'``:

    .. figure:: ../_static/layer_interferometer.png
        :align: center
        :width: 60%
        :target: javascript:void(0);

    .. note::

        The decomposition as formulated in :cite:`clements2016optimal` uses a different
        convention for a beamsplitter :math:`T(\theta, \phi)` than PennyLane, namely:

        .. math:: T(\theta, \phi) = BS(\theta, 0) R(\phi)

        For the universality of the decomposition, the used convention is irrelevant, but
        for a given set of angles the resulting interferometers will be different.

        If an interferometer consistent with the convention from :cite:`clements2016optimal`
        is needed, the optional keyword argument ``beamsplitter='clements'`` can be specified. This
        will result in each :class:`~pennylane.ops.Beamsplitter` being preceded by a :class:`~pennylane.ops.Rotation` and
        thus increase the number of elementary operations in the circuit.
