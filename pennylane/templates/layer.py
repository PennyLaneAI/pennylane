        **Layering Gates**

        The layering function can be used to repeatedly apply a function containing quantum operations,
        a template, or a quantum gate.

        For example, we can define the following subroutine:

        .. code-block:: python3

            import pennylane as qml
            import numpy as np

            def subroutine():
                qml.Hadamard(wires=[0])
                qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
                qml.PauliX(wires=[1])

        and then pass it into the ``qml.layer`` function. In this instance, we repeat ``subroutine`` three times:

        .. code-block:: python3

            dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=3)

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit():
                qml.layer(subroutine, 3)
                return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0)), qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(1))]


        This creates the following circuit:

        >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())
        0: ──H─╭●──H─╭●──H─╭●────┤  <Z>
        1: ────╰X──X─╰X──X─╰X──X─┤  <Z>

        **Static Arguments**

        Static arguments are arguments passed into ``template`` that don't change with each
        repetition. Static parameters are always passed as keyword arguments into ``qml.layer``.
        For example, consider the following subroutine:

        .. code-block:: python3

            def subroutine(wires):
                qml.Hadamard(wires=wires[0])
                qml.CNOT(wires=wires)
                qml.PauliX(wires=wires[1])

        We wish to repeat this gate sequence three times on wires ``1`` and ``2``. Since the wires on which the subroutine acts
        don't change with each repetition, the ``wires`` parameter is passed as a keyword argument.
        Therefore, we define a circuit as:

        .. code-block:: python3

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit():
                qml.layer(subroutine, 3, wires=[1, 2])
                return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(1)), qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(2))]

        which yields the following circuit:

        >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())
        1: ──H─╭●──H─╭●──H─╭●────┤  <Z>
        2: ────╰X──X─╰X──X─╰X──X─┤  <Z>

        **Dynamic Arguments**

        In addition to passing static arguments to ``template``, we can also pass dynamic arguments.
        These are arguments that change with each repetition of the unitary. They are passed
        as non-keyword arguments to ``qml.layer``, after ``template`` and ``depth``. Each dynamic parameter must
        be a list of length equal to ``depth``. The :math:`j`-th element of the list represents the value of the
        argument used for the :math:`j`-th repetition.

        For example, let us define the following variational ansatz:

        .. code-block:: python3

            def ansatz(params):
                qml.RX(params[0], wires=[0])
                qml.MultiRZ(params[1], wires=[0, 1])
                qml.RY(params[2], wires=[1])

        We wish to repeat this ansatz two times, with each layer having different ``params``:

        .. code-block:: python3

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(params):
                qml.layer(ansatz, 2, params)
                return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0)), qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(1))]

        Since we only have one dynamic argument, ``params``, we pass an array of first-dimension two,
        for the two layers of the repeated ansatz. We can also see that the ``params`` argument
        supplies three different parameters to three different gates. We therefore supply an array of size
        (2, 3) as an argument to ``qml.layer``:

        .. code-block:: python3

            params = np.array([[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0.4, 0.4, 0.4]])

        which yields the following circuit:

        >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)(params))
        0: ──RX(0.50)─╭MultiRZ(0.50)──RX(0.40)─╭MultiRZ(0.40)───────────┤  <Z>
        1: ───────────╰MultiRZ(0.50)──RY(0.50)─╰MultiRZ(0.40)──RY(0.40)─┤  <Z>

        **Passing Multiple Static and Dynamic Arguments**

        It is also possible to pass multiple static and dynamic arguments into the same unitary. Dynamic
        arguments must be ordered in ``qml.layer`` in the same order in which they are passed into the
        ``template``.

        Consider the following ansatz:

        .. code-block:: python3

            def ansatz(param1, param2, wires, var):
                qml.RX(param1, wires=wires[0])
                qml.MultiRZ(param2, wires=wires)

                if var:
                    qml.Hadamard(wires=wires[1])

        This circuit can be repeated as:

        .. code-block:: python3

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(param1, param2):
                qml.layer(ansatz, 2, param1, param2, wires=[1, 2], var=True)
                return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(1)), qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(2))]

        We can then run the circuit with a given set of parameters (note that the parameters are
        of size (2, 1), as the circuit is repeated twice, and for each repetition, both ``param1`` and
        ``param2`` are simply real numbers):

        .. code-block:: python3

            param1 = np.array([0.1, 0.2])
            param2 = np.array([0.3, 0.4])

        This gives us the following circuit:

        >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)(param1, param2))
        1: ──RX(0.10)─╭MultiRZ(0.30)──RX(0.20)─╭MultiRZ(0.40)────┤  <Z>
        2: ───────────╰MultiRZ(0.30)──H────────╰MultiRZ(0.40)──H─┤  <Z>
