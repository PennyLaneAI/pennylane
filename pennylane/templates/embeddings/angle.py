@template
def AngleEmbedding(features, wires, rotation="X"):
    r"""
    Encodes :math:`N` features into the rotation angles of :math:`n` qubits, where :math:`N \leq n`.

    The rotations can be chosen as either :class:`~pennylane.ops.RX`, :class:`~pennylane.ops.RY`
    or :class:`~pennylane.ops.RZ` gates, as defined by the ``rotation`` parameter:

    * ``rotation='X'`` uses the features as angles of RX rotations

    * ``rotation='Y'`` uses the features as angles of RY rotations

    * ``rotation='Z'`` uses the features as angles of RZ rotations

    The length of ``features`` has to be smaller or equal to the number of qubits. If there are fewer entries in
    ``features`` than rotations, the circuit does not apply the remaining rotation gates.

    Args:
        features (array): input array of shape ``(N,)``, where N is the number of input features to embed,
            with :math:`N\leq n`
        wires (Iterable or Wires): Wires that the template acts on. Accepts an iterable of numbers or strings, or
            a Wires object.
        rotation (str): Type of rotations used

    Raises:
        ValueError: if inputs do not have the correct format
