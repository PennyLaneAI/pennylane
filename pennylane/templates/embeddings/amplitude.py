class AmplitudeEmbedding(StatePrep):
    r"""Encodes :math:`2^n` features into the amplitude vector of :math:`n` qubits.

    By setting ``pad_with`` to a real or complex number, ``features`` is automatically padded to dimension
    :math:`2^n` where :math:`n` is the number of qubits used in the embedding.

    To represent a valid quantum state vector, the L2-norm of ``features`` must be one.
    The argument ``normalize`` can be set to ``True`` to automatically normalize the features.

    If both automatic padding and normalization are used, padding is executed *before* normalizing.

    .. note::

        On some devices, ``AmplitudeEmbedding`` must be the first operation of a quantum circuit.

    .. warning::

        At the moment, the ``features`` argument is **not differentiable** when using the template, and
        gradients with respect to the features cannot be computed by PennyLane.

    Args:
        features (tensor_like): input tensor of dimension ``(2^len(wires),)``, or less if `pad_with` is specified
        wires (Any or Iterable[Any]): wires that the template acts on
        pad_with (float or complex): if not None, the input is padded with this constant to size :math:`2^n`
        normalize (bool): whether to automatically normalize the features
        id (str): custom label given to an operator instance,
            can be useful for some applications where the instance has to be identified.

    Example:

        Amplitude embedding encodes a normalized :math:`2^n`-dimensional feature vector into the state
        of :math:`n` qubits:

        .. code-block:: python

            import pennylane as qml

            dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=2)

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(f=None):
                qml.AmplitudeEmbedding(features=f, wires=range(2))
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0)), qml.state()

            res, state = circuit(f=[1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2])

        The final state of the device is - up to a global phase - equivalent to the input passed to the circuit:

        >>> state
        tensor([0.5+0.j, 0.5+0.j, 0.5+0.j, 0.5+0.j], requires_grad=True)

        **Differentiating with respect to the features**

        Due to non-trivial classical processing to construct the state preparation circuit,
        the features argument is in general **not differentiable**.

        **Normalization**

        The template will raise an error if the feature input is not normalized.
        One can set ``normalize=True`` to automatically normalize it:

        .. code-block:: python

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(f=None):
                qml.AmplitudeEmbedding(features=f, wires=range(2), normalize=True)
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0)), qml.state()

            res, state = circuit(f=[15, 15, 15, 15])

        >>> state
        tensor([0.5+0.j, 0.5+0.j, 0.5+0.j, 0.5+0.j], requires_grad=True)

        **Padding**

        If the dimension of the feature vector is smaller than the number of amplitudes,
        one can automatically pad it with a constant for the missing dimensions using the ``pad_with`` option:

        .. code-block:: python

            from math import sqrt

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(f=None):
                qml.AmplitudeEmbedding(features=f, wires=range(2), pad_with=0.)
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0)), qml.state()

            res, state = circuit(f=[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)])

        >>> state
        tensor([0.70710678+0.j, 0.70710678+0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.        +0.j], requires_grad=True)
