    For example, for ``features=np.array([0, 1, 0])``, the quantum system will be
    prepared in state :math:`|010 \rangle`.

    .. warning::

        ``BasisEmbedding`` calls a circuit whose architecture depends on the binary features.
        The ``features`` argument is therefore not differentiable when using the template, and
        gradients with respect to the argument cannot be computed by PennyLane.

    Args:
        features (array): binary input array of shape ``(n, )``
        wires (Iterable or Wires): Wires that the template acts on. Accepts an iterable of numbers or strings, or
            a Wires object.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if inputs do not have the correct format
