    """The TTN template broadcasts an input circuit across many wires following the architecture of a tree tensor network.
    The result is similar to the architecture in `arXiv:1803.11537 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11537>`_.

    The argument ``block`` is a user-defined quantum circuit. Each ``block`` may depend on a different set of parameters.
    These are passed as a list by the ``template_weights`` argument.

    For more details, see *Usage Details* below.

    Args:
        wires (Iterable): wires that the template acts on
        n_block_wires (int): number of wires per block
        block (Callable): quantum circuit that defines a block
        n_params_block (int): the number of parameters in a block
        template_weights (Sequence): list containing the weights for all blocks

    .. details::
        :title: Usage Details

        In general, the block takes D parameters and **must** have the following signature:

        .. code-block:: python

            unitary(parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterD, wires)

        For a block with multiple parameters, ``n_params_block`` is equal to the number of parameters in ``block``.
        For a block with a single parameter, ``n_params_block`` is equal to the length of the parameter.

        To avoid using ragged arrays, all block parameters should have the same dimension.

        The length of the ``template_weights`` argument should match the number of blocks.
        The expected number of blocks can be obtained from ``qml.TTN.get_n_blocks(wires, n_block_wires)``.

        This example demonstrates the use of ``TTN`` for a simple block.

        .. code-block:: python

            import pennylane as qml
            import numpy as np

            def block(weights, wires):

            n_block_wires = 2
            n_params_block = 2
