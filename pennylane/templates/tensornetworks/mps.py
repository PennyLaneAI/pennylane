    The result is similar to the architecture in `arXiv:1803.11537 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11537>`_.

    The argument ``block`` is a user-defined quantum circuit.``block`` should have two arguments: ``weights`` and ``wires``.
    For clarity, it is recommended to use a one-dimensional list or array for the block weights.

    Args:
        wires (Iterable): wires that the template acts on
        n_block_wires (int): number of wires per block
        block (Callable): quantum circuit that defines a block
        n_params_block (int): the number of parameters in a block; equal to the length of the ``weights`` argument in ``block``
        template_weights (Sequence): list containing the weights for all blocks

    .. note::

        The expected number of blocks can be obtained from ``qml.MPS.n_blocks(wires, n_block_wires)``.
        The length of ``template_weights`` argument should match the number of blocks.
