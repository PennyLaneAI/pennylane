Base templates serve as building blocks for other templates. They define a fundamental structure of how to arrange
a unitary on a set of wires. The unitary can be represented by a PennyLane :meth:`~.pennylane.operations.Operation`,
or by a user-defined template that consists of a sequence of gates.
It can also be parametrized, in which case the parameters are passed to the constructors template, which feeds them into
the unitary.
