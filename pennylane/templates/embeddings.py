def AngleEmbedding(features, wires, rotation='X'):
    r"""
    Encodes :math:`N` features into the rotation angles of :math:`n` qubits, where :math:`N \leq n`.

    The rotations can be chosen as either :class:`~pennylane.ops.RX`, :class:`~pennylane.ops.RY`
    or :class:`~pennylane.ops.RZ` gates, as defined by the ``rotation`` parameter:

    * ``rotation='X'`` uses the features as angles of RX rotations

    * ``rotation='Y'`` uses the features as angles of RY rotations

    * ``rotation='Z'`` uses the features as angles of RZ rotations

    The length of ``features`` has to be smaller or equal to the number of qubits. If there are fewer entries in
    ``features`` than rotations, the circuit does not apply the remaining rotation gates.

    This embedding method can also be used to encode a binary sequence into a basis state. For example, to prepare
    basis state :math:`|0,1,1,0\rangle`, choose ``rotation='X'`` and use the
    feature vector :math:`[0, \pi/2, \pi/2, 0]`. Alternatively, one can use the :mod:`BasisEmbedding()` template.

    Args:
        features (array): Input array of shape ``(N,)``, where N is the number of input features to embed,
            with :math:`N\leq n`
        wires (Sequence[int]): sequence of qubit indices that the template acts on

    If the total number of features to embed are less than the :math:`2^n` available amplitudes,
    non-informative constants (zeros) can be padded to ``features``. To enable this, the argument
    ``pad`` should be set to ``True``.

    The L2-norm of ``features`` must be one. By default, AmplitudeEmbedding expects a normalized
    feature vector. The argument ``normalize`` can be set to ``True`` to automatically normalize it.
