**Module name:** :mod:`pennylane.templates.embeddings`

.. currentmodule:: pennylane.templates.embeddings

This module provides quantum circuit architectures that can embed features into a quantum state.
The features are associated with gate parameters, implicitly mapping them into the Hilbert space of the quantum state
(see also Schuld & Killoran 2019 :cite:`schuld2018quantum`).

def AngleEmbedding(features, rotation='X', wires=None):
    r"""
    Encodes :math:`n` features into the rotation angles of :math:`n` qubits.

    The rotations can be chosen as either :class:`~.RX`, :class:`~.RY`
    or :class:`~.RZ` gates, as defined by the ``rotation`` parameter:

    * ``rotation='X'`` uses the features to chronologically apply RX rotations to qubits

    * ``rotation='Y'`` uses the features to chronologically apply RY rotations to qubits

    * ``rotation='Z'`` uses the features to chronologically apply RZ rotations to qubits

    The length of ``features`` has to be smaller or equal to the number of qubits. If there are fewer entries in
    ``features`` than rotations, the circuit does not apply the remaining rotation gates.

    This embedding method can also be used to encode a binary sequence into a basis state. Choose ``rotation='X'``
    and features of a nonzero value of :math:`\pi /2` only where a qubit has to be prepared in state 1.

    Args:
        features (array): Input array of shape ``(N, )``, where N is the number of input features to embed
