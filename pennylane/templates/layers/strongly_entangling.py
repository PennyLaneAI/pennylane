    r"""Layers consisting of single qubit rotations and entanglers, inspired by the circuit-centric classifier design
    `arXiv:1804.00633 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00633>`_.

    The argument ``weights`` contains the weights for each layer. The number of layers :math:`L` is therefore derived
    from the first dimension of ``weights``.

    The 2-qubit gates, whose type is specified by the ``imprimitive`` argument,
    act chronologically on the :math:`M` wires, :math:`i = 1,...,M`. The second qubit of each gate is given by
    :math:`(i+r)\mod M`, where :math:`r` is a  hyperparameter called the *range*, and :math:`0 < r < M`.
    If applied to one qubit only, this template will use no imprimitive gates.

    This is an example of two 4-qubit strongly entangling layers (ranges :math:`r=1` and :math:`r=2`, respectively) with
    rotations :math:`R` and CNOTs as imprimitives:

    .. figure:: ../../_static/layer_sec.png
        :align: center
        :width: 60%
        :target: javascript:void(0);

    Args:

        weights (tensor_like): weight tensor of shape ``(L, M, 3)``
        wires (Iterable or Wires): Wires that the template acts on. Accepts an iterable of numbers or strings, or
            a Wires object.
        ranges (Sequence[int]): sequence determining the range hyperparameter for each subsequent layer; if None
                                using :math:`r=l \mod M` for the :math:`l`th layer and :math:`M` wires.
        imprimitive (pennylane.ops.Operation): two-qubit gate to use, defaults to :class:`~pennylane.ops.CNOT`
