class StronglyEntanglingLayers(Operation):
    r"""Layers consisting of single qubit rotations and entanglers, inspired by the circuit-centric classifier design
    `arXiv:1804.00633 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00633>`_.

    The argument ``weights`` contains the weights for each layer. The number of layers :math:`L` is therefore derived
    from the first dimension of ``weights``.

    The 2-qubit gates, whose type is specified by the ``imprimitive`` argument,
    act chronologically on the :math:`M` wires, :math:`i = 1,...,M`. The second qubit of each gate is given by
    :math:`(i+r)\mod M`, where :math:`r` is a  hyperparameter called the *range*, and :math:`0 < r < M`.
    If applied to one qubit only, this template will use no imprimitive gates.

    This is an example of two 4-qubit strongly entangling layers (ranges :math:`r=1` and :math:`r=2`, respectively) with
    rotations :math:`R` and CNOTs as imprimitives:

    .. figure:: ../../_static/layer_sec.png
        :align: center
        :width: 60%
        :target: javascript:void(0);

    .. note::
        The two-qubit gate used as the imprimitive or entangler must not depend on parameters.

    Args:

        weights (tensor_like): weight tensor of shape ``(L, M, 3)``
        wires (Iterable): wires that the template acts on
        ranges (Sequence[int]): sequence determining the range hyperparameter for each subsequent layer; if ``None``
                                using :math:`r=l \mod M` for the :math:`l` th layer and :math:`M` wires.
        imprimitive (type of pennylane.ops.Operation): two-qubit gate to use, defaults to :class:`~pennylane.ops.CNOT`

    Example:

        There are multiple arguments that the user can use to customize the layer.

        The required arguments are ``weights`` and ``wires``.

        .. code-block:: python

            dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=4)

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(parameters):
                qml.StronglyEntanglingLayers(weights=parameters, wires=range(4))
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

            shape = qml.StronglyEntanglingLayers.shape(n_layers=2, n_wires=4)
            weights = np.random.random(size=shape)

        The shape of the ``weights`` argument decides the number of layers.

        The resulting circuit is:

        >>> print(qml.draw(circuit, expansion_strategy="device")(weights))
        0: ──Rot(0.68,0.98,0.48)─╭●───────╭X──Rot(0.94,0.22,0.70)─╭●────╭X────┤  <Z>
        1: ──Rot(0.91,0.19,0.15)─╰X─╭●────│───Rot(0.50,0.20,0.63)─│──╭●─│──╭X─┤
        2: ──Rot(0.91,0.68,0.96)────╰X─╭●─│───Rot(0.14,0.05,0.16)─╰X─│──╰●─│──┤
        3: ──Rot(0.46,0.56,0.80)───────╰X─╰●──Rot(0.87,0.04,0.22)────╰X────╰●─┤

        The default two-qubit gate used is :class:`~pennylane.ops.CNOT`. This can be changed by using the ``imprimitive`` argument.

        The ``ranges`` argument takes an integer sequence where each element
        determines the range hyperparameter for each layer. This range hyperparameter
        is the difference of the wire indices representing the two qubits the
        ``imprimitive`` gate acts on. For example, for ``range=[2,3]`` the
        first layer will have a range parameter of ``2`` and the second layer will
        have a range parameter of ``3``.
        Assuming ``wires=[0, 1, 2, 3]`` and a range parameter of ``2``, there will be
        an imprimitive gate acting on:

        * qubits ``(0, 2)``;
        * qubits ``(1, 3)``;
        * qubits ``(2, 0)``;
        * qubits ``(3, 1)``.

        .. code-block:: python

            dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=4)

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(parameters):
                qml.StronglyEntanglingLayers(weights=parameters, wires=range(4), ranges=[2, 3], imprimitive=qml.ops.CZ)
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

            shape = qml.StronglyEntanglingLayers.shape(n_layers=2, n_wires=4)
            weights = np.random.random(size=shape)

        The resulting circuit is:

        >>> print(qml.draw(circuit, expansion_strategy="device")(weights))
        0: ──Rot(0.99,0.17,0.12)─╭●────╭Z──Rot(0.02,0.94,0.57)──────────────────────╭●─╭Z───────┤  <Z>
