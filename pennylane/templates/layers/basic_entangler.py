class BasicEntanglerLayers(Operation):
    r"""Layers consisting of one-parameter single-qubit rotations on each qubit, followed by a closed chain
    or *ring* of CNOT gates.

    The ring of CNOT gates connects every qubit with its neighbour,
    with the last qubit being considered as a neighbour to the first qubit.

    .. figure:: ../../_static/templates/layers/basic_entangler.png
        :align: center
        :width: 40%
        :target: javascript:void(0);

    The number of layers :math:`L` is determined by the first dimension of the argument ``weights``.
    When using a single wire, the template only applies the single
    qubit gates in each layer.

    .. note::

        This template follows the convention of dropping the entanglement between the last and the first
        qubit when using only two wires, so the entangler is not repeated on the same wires.
        In this case, only one CNOT gate is applied in each layer:

        .. figure:: ../../_static/templates/layers/basic_entangler_2wires.png
            :align: center
            :width: 30%
            :target: javascript:void(0);

    Args:
        weights (tensor_like): Weight tensor of shape ``(L, len(wires))``. Each weight is used as a parameter
            for the rotation.
        wires (Iterable): wires that the template acts on
        rotation (pennylane.ops.Operation): one-parameter single-qubit gate to use,
            if ``None``, :class:`~pennylane.ops.RX` is used as default

    Raises:
        ValueError: if inputs do not have the correct format

    .. details::
        :title: Usage Details

        The template is used inside a qnode:

        .. code-block:: python

            import pennylane as qml
            from math import pi

            n_wires = 3
            dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=n_wires)

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(weights):
                qml.BasicEntanglerLayers(weights=weights, wires=range(n_wires))
                return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=i)) for i in range(n_wires)]

        >>> circuit([[pi, pi, pi]])
        [1., 1., -1.]

        **Parameter shape**

        The shape of the weights argument can be computed by the static method
        :meth:`~.BasicEntanglerLayers.shape` and used when creating randomly
        initialised weight tensors:

        .. code-block:: python

            shape = qml.BasicEntanglerLayers.shape(n_layers=2, n_wires=2)
            weights = np.random.random(size=shape)

        **No periodic boundary for two wires**

        When using two wires, the convention is to drop the periodic boundary condition.
        This means that the connection from the second to the first wire is omitted.

        .. code-block:: python

            n_wires = 2
            dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=n_wires)

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(weights):
                qml.BasicEntanglerLayers(weights=weights, wires=range(n_wires))
                return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=i)) for i in range(n_wires)]

        >>> circuit([[pi, pi]])
        [-1, 1]


        **Changing the rotation gate**

        Any single-qubit gate can be used as a rotation gate, as long as it only takes a single parameter. The default is the ``RX`` gate.

        .. code-block:: python

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(weights):
                qml.BasicEntanglerLayers(weights=weights, wires=range(n_wires), rotation=qml.RZ)
                return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=i)) for i in range(n_wires)]

        Accidentally using a gate that expects more parameters throws a
        ``ValueError: Wrong number of parameters``.
