    The following abstract method **must** be defined:

    * :meth:`~.apply`: append circuit operations, compile the circuit (if applicable),
      and perform the quantum computation.

    Devices that generate their own samples (such as hardware) may optionally
    overwrite :meth:`~.probability`. This method otherwise automatically
    computes the probabilities from the generated samples, and **must**
    overwrite the following method:

    * :meth:`~.generate_samples`: Generate samples from the device from the
      exact or approximate probability distribution.

    Analytic devices **must** overwrite the following method:

    * :meth:`~.analytic_probability`: returns the probability or marginal probability from the
      device after circuit execution. :meth:`~.marginal_prob` may be used here.

    This device contains common utility methods for qubit-based devices. These
    do not need to be overwritten. Utility methods include:

    * :meth:`~.expval`, :meth:`~.var`, :meth:`~.sample`: return expectation values,
      variances, and samples of observables after the circuit has been rotated
      into the observable eigenbasis.

    Args:
        wires (int, Iterable[Number, str]]): Number of subsystems represented by the device,
            or iterable that contains unique labels for the subsystems as numbers (i.e., ``[-1, 0, 2]``)
            or strings (``['ancilla', 'q1', 'q2']``). Default 1 if not specified.
        shots (None, int, list[int]): Number of circuit evaluations/random samples used to estimate
            expectation values of observables. If ``None``, the device calculates probability, expectation values,
            and variances analytically. If an integer, it specifies the number of samples to estimate these quantities.
            If a list of integers is passed, the circuit evaluations are batched over the list of shots.

            :title: Usage Details

            The ``shot_range`` and ``bin_size`` arguments allow for the statistics
            to be performed on only a subset of device samples. This finer level
            of control is accessible from the main UI by instantiating a device
            with a batch of shots.

            For example, consider the following device:

            >>> dev = qml.device("my_device", shots=[5, (10, 3), 100])

            This device will execute QNodes using 135 shots, however
            measurement statistics will be **course grained** across these 135
            shots:

            * All measurement statistics will first be computed using the
              first 5 shots --- that is, ``shots_range=[0, 5]``, ``bin_size=5``.

            * Next, the tuple ``(10, 3)`` indicates 10 shots, repeated 3 times. We will want to use
              ``shot_range=[5, 35]``, performing the expectation value in bins of size 10
              (``bin_size=10``).

            * Finally, we repeat the measurement statistics for the final 100 shots,
              ``shot_range=[35, 135]``, ``bin_size=100``.

        Returns the measured bits and recipes in the classical shadow protocol.

        The protocol is described in detail in the `classical shadows paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08953>`_.
        This measurement process returns the randomized Pauli measurements (the ``recipes``)
        that are performed for each qubit and snapshot as an integer:

        - 0 for Pauli X,
        - 1 for Pauli Y, and
        - 2 for Pauli Z.

        It also returns the measurement results (the ``bits``); 0 if the 1 eigenvalue
        is sampled, and 1 if the -1 eigenvalue is sampled.

        The device shots are used to specify the number of snapshots. If ``T`` is the number
        of shots and ``n`` is the number of qubits, then both the measured bits and the
        Pauli measurements have shape ``(T, n)``.

        This implementation is device-agnostic and works by executing single-shot
        tapes containing randomized Pauli observables. Devices should override this
        if they can offer cleaner or faster implementations.
