class QubitDevice(Device):
    """Abstract base class for PennyLane qubit devices.

    The following abstract method **must** be defined:

    * :meth:`~.apply`: append circuit operations, compile the circuit (if applicable),
      and perform the quantum computation.

    Devices that generate their own samples (such as hardware) may optionally
    overwrite :meth:`~.probabilty`. This method otherwise automatically
    computes the probabilities from the generated samples, and **must**
    overwrite the following method:

    * :meth:`~.generate_samples`: Generate samples from the device from the
      exact or approximate probability distribution.

    Analytic devices **must** overwrite the following method:

    * :meth:`~.analytic_probability`: returns the probability or marginal probability from the
      device after circuit execution. :meth:`~.marginal_prob` may be used here.

    This device contains common utility methods for qubit-based devices. These
    do not need to be overwritten. Utility methods include:

    * :meth:`~.expval`, :meth:`~.var`, :meth:`~.sample`: return expectation values,
      variances, and samples of observables after the circuit has been rotated
      into the observable eigenbasis.

    Args:
        wires (int, Iterable[Number, str]]): Number of subsystems represented by the device,
            or iterable that contains unique labels for the subsystems as numbers (i.e., ``[-1, 0, 2]``)
            or strings (``['ancilla', 'q1', 'q2']``). Default 1 if not specified.
        shots (None, int, list[int]): Number of circuit evaluations/random samples used to estimate
            expectation values of observables. If ``None``, the device calculates probability, expectation values,
            and variances analytically. If an integer, it specifies the number of samples to estimate these quantities.
            If a list of integers is passed, the circuit evaluations are batched over the list of shots.
        cache (int): Number of device executions to store in a cache to speed up subsequent
            executions. A value of ``0`` indicates that no caching will take place. Once filled,
            older elements of the cache are removed and replaced with the most recent device
            executions to keep the cache up to date.

            The ``shot_range`` and ``bin_size`` arguments allow for the statistics

            of control is accessible from the main UI by instantiating a device
            with a batch of shots.

            For example, consider the following device:

            >>> dev = qml.device("my_device", shots=[5, (10, 3), 100])

            This device will execute QNodes using 135 shots, however
            measurement statistics will be **course grained** across these 135
            shots:

            * All measurement statistics will first be computed using the
              first 5 shots --- that is, ``shots_range=[0, 5]``, ``bin_size=5``.

            * Next, the tuple ``(10, 3)`` indicates 10 shots, repeated 3 times. We will want to use
              ``shot_range=[5, 35]``, performing the expectation value in bins of size 10
              (``bin_size=10``).

            * Finally, we repeat the measurement statistics for the final 100 shots,
              ``shot_range=[35, 135]``, ``bin_size=100``.
