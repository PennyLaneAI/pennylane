    Python standard library executor class backed by ``multiprocessing.Pool``.

    This executor wraps Python standard library `multiprocessing.Pool <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.pool>`_ interface, and provides support for execution using multiple processes.

    Args:
        max_workers: the maximum number of concurrent units (processes) to use
        persist: allow the executor backend to persist between executions. True avoids
                    potentially costly set-up and tear-down, where supported.
                    Explicit calls to ``shutdown`` will set this to False.
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass-through to the executor backend.
