    Serial Python standard library executor class.

    This executor wraps Python standard library calls without support for multithreaded or multiprocess execution. Any calls to external libraries that utilize threads, such as BLAS through numpy, can still use multithreaded calls at that layer.

    Args:
        max_workers:    the maximum number of concurrent units (threads, processes) to use. The serial backend defaults to 1 and will return a ``RuntimeError`` if more are requested.
        persist:        allow the executor backend to persist between executions. This is ignored for the serial backend.
        **kwargs:   Keyword arguments to pass-through to the executor backend. This is ignored for the serial backend.
