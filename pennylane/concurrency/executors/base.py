Contains concurrent executor abstractions for task-based workloads.

All of the base abstractions for building an executor follow a simplified `concurrent.futures.Executor <https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#executor-objects>`_ interface. Given the differences observed in support for ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` in various modes of execution, the abstractions provide a fixed API to interface with each backend, performing function and argument transformations, where necessary.

To build a new executor backend, the following classes provide scaffolding to simplify abstracting the function call signatures between each backend interface layer.

@dataclass
class ExecBackendConfig:
    r"""
    Executor backend configuration data-class.

    To allow for differences in each executor backend implementation, this class dynamically defines overloads to the main API functions. For explicitly-defined executors, this class is optional, and is provided for convenience with hierarchical inheritance class structures, where subtle differences are best resolved dynamically, rather than with API modifications. All initial values default to ``None``.

    Args:
        submit_fn (str, None): The backend function that best matches the ``submit`` API call.
        map_fn (str): The backend function that best matches the ``map`` API call.
        starmap_fn (str, None): The backend function that best matches the ``starmap`` API call.
        shutdown_fn (str, None): The backend function that best matches the ``shutdown`` API call.
        submit_unpack (bool, None): Whether the arguments to ``submit`` are to be unpacked (``*args``) or directly passed (``args``) to ``submit_fn``.
        map_unpack (bool): Whether the arguments to ``map`` are to be unpacked (``*args``) or directly passed (``args``) to ``map_unpack``.
        blocking (bool, None): Whether the return values from ``submit``, ``map`` and ``starmap`` are blocking (synchronous) or non-blocking (asynchronous).

    Args:
        max_workers (int): The size of the worker pool. This value will directly control (given backend support)
            the number of concurrent executions that the backend can avail of. Generally, this value should match
            the number of physical cores on the executing system, or with the executing remote environment. Defaults
            to ``None``, which defers to support provided by the child class.
        persist (bool): Indicates to the executor backend that the state should persist between
            calls. If supported, this allows a pre-configured device to be reused for several
            computations but removing the need to automatically shutdown. The pool may require
            manual shutdown upon completion of the work, even if the executor goes out-of-scope.
