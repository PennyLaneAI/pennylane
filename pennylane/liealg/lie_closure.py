    r"""Compute the dynamical Lie algebra from a set of generators.

    The Lie closure, pronounced "Lee" closure, is a way to compute the so-called dynamical Lie algebra (DLA) of a set of generators :math:`\mathcal{G} = \{G_1, .. , G_N\}`.
    For such generators, one computes all nested commutators :math:`[G_i, [G_j, .., [G_k, G_\ell]]]` until no new operators are generated from commutation.
    All these operators together form the DLA, see e.g. section IIB of `arXiv:2308.01432 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01432>`__.

    Args:
        generators (Iterable[Union[PauliWord, PauliSentence, Operator, TensorLike]]): generating set for which to compute the
            Lie closure.
        max_iterations (int): maximum depth of nested commutators to consider. Default is ``10000``.
        verbose (bool): whether to print out progress updates during Lie closure
            calculation. Default is ``False``.
        pauli (bool): Indicates whether it is assumed that :class:`~.PauliSentence` or :class:`~.PauliWord` instances are input and returned.
            This can help with performance to avoid unnecessary conversions to :class:`~pennylane.operation.Operator`
            and vice versa. Default is ``False``.
        matrix (bool): Whether or not matrix representations should be used and returned in the Lie closure computation. This can help
            speed up the computation when using sums of Paulis with many terms. Default is ``False``.
        tol (float): Numerical tolerance for the linear independence check used in :class:`~.PauliVSpace`.

    Returns:
        Union[list[:class:`~.PauliSentence`], list[:class:`~.Operator`], np.ndarray]: A basis of either :class:`~.PauliSentence`,
        :class:`~.Operator`, or ``np.ndarray`` instances that is closed under commutators (Lie closure).

    **Example**

    >>> ops = [X(0) @ X(1), Z(0), Z(1)]
    >>> dla = qml.lie_closure(ops)

    Let us walk through what happens in this simple example of computing the Lie closure of these generators (the transverse field Ising model on two qubits).
    A first round of commutators between all elements yields:

    >>> qml.commutator(X(0) @ X(1), Z(0))
    -2j * (Y(0) @ X(1))
    >>> qml.commutator(X(0) @ X(1), Z(1))
    -2j * (X(0) @ Y(1))

    A next round of commutators between all elements further yields the new operator ``Y(0) @ Y(1)``.

    >>> qml.commutator(X(0) @ Y(1), Z(0))
    -2j * (Y(0) @ Y(1))

    After that, no new operators emerge from taking nested commutators and we have the resulting DLA.
    This can be done in short via ``lie_closure`` as follows.

    >>> ops = [X(0) @ X(1), Z(0), Z(1)]
    >>> dla = qml.lie_closure(ops)
    >>> print(dla)
    [X(1) @ X(0),
     Z(0),
     Z(1),
     -1.0 * (Y(0) @ X(1)),
     -1.0 * (X(0) @ Y(1)),
     -1.0 * (Y(0) @ Y(1))]

    Note that we normalize by removing the factors of :math:`2i`, though minus signs are left intact.

    .. details::
        :title: Usage Details

        Note that by default, ``lie_closure`` returns PennyLane operators. Internally we use the more
        efficient representation in terms of :class:`~pennylane.pauli.PauliSentence` by making use of the ``op.pauli_rep``
        attribute of operators composed of Pauli operators. If desired, this format can be returned by using
        the keyword ``pauli=True``. In that case, the input is also assumed to be a :class:`~pennylane.pauli.PauliSentence` instance.

        >>> ops = [
        ...     PauliSentence({PauliWord({0: "X", 1: "X"}): 1.}),
        ...     PauliSentence({PauliWord({0: "Z"}): 1.}),
        ...     PauliSentence({PauliWord({1: "Z"}): 1.}),
        ... ]
        >>> dla = qml.lie_closure(ops, pauli=True)
        >>> print(dla)
        [1.0 * X(0) @ X(1),
         1.0 * Z(0),
         1.0 * Z(1),
         -1.0 * Y(0) @ X(1),
         -1.0 * X(0) @ Y(1),
         -1.0 * Y(0) @ Y(1)]
        >>> type(dla[0])
        pennylane.pauli.pauli_arithmetic.PauliSentence

        In the case of sums of Pauli operators with many terms, it is often faster to use the matrix representation of the operators rather than
        the semi-analytic :class:`~pennylane.pauli.PauliSentence` or :class:`~Operator` representation.
        We can force this by using the ``matrix`` keyword. The resulting ``dla`` is a ``np.ndarray`` of dimension ``(dim_g, 2**n, 2**n)``, where ``dim_g`` is the
        dimension of the DLA and ``n`` the number of qubits.

        >>> dla = qml.lie_closure(ops, matrix=True)
        >>> dla.shape
        (6, 4, 4)

        You can retrieve a semi-analytic representation again by using :func:`~pauli_decompose`.

        >>> dla_ops = [qml.pauli_decompose(op) for op in dla]

    Returns:

    **Example**

    Compute the Lie closure of the isotropic Heisenberg model with generators :math:`\{X_i X_{i+1} + Y_i Y_{i+1} + Z_i Z_{i+1}\}_{i=0}^{n-1}`.

    >>> n = 5
    >>> gens = [X(i) @ X(i+1) + Y(i) @ Y(i+1) + Z(i) @ Z(i+1) for i in range(n-1)]
    >>> g = _lie_closure_matrix(gens)

    >>> g_ops = [qml.pauli_decompose(op) for op in g]

    **Internal representation**

    The input operators are converted to Hermitian matrices internally. This means
    that we compute the operators :math:`G_\alpha` in the algebra :math:`\{iG_\alpha\}_\alpha`,
    which itself consists of skew-Hermitian objects (commutators produce skew-Hermitian objects,
    so Hermitian operators alone can not form an algebra with the standard commutator).
