    An "occupied wire" will have something on top of it in the final drawing.  This could
    be a wire used by an operation or a wire between those used in a multi-qubit gate.

    In this function, we work with wires that are ordered, sequential integers, not the general
    hashable label that operations act on. ``drawable_layers`` performs this conversion.

        layer_to_check (int): the function determines if the operation fits on this layer
        op_occupied_wires (set(int)): wires covered the drawn operation.  Includes everything

        occupied_wires_per_layer (list[set[int]]): which wires already have something drawn
            on them. Each set is a different layer.

    Args:
        ops Iterable[~.Operator]: a list of operations

    Keyword Args:
        wire_map=None (dict): a map from wire label to non-negative integers

    Returns:
        list[set[~.Operator]] : Each index is a set of operations
        for the corresponding layer

    **Details**

    The function recursively pushes operations as far to the left (lowest layer) possible
    *without* altering order.

    From the start, the function cares about the locations the operation altered
    during a drawing, not just the wires the operation acts on. An "occupied" wire
    refers to a wire that will be altered in the drawing of an operation.
    Assuming wire ``1`` is between ``0`` and ``2`` in the ordering, ``qml.CNOT(wires=(0,2))``
    will also "occupy" wire ``1``.  In this scenario, an operation on wire ``1``, like
    ``qml.PauliX(wires=1)``, will not be pushed to the left
    of the ``qml.CNOT(wires=(0,2))`` gate, but be blocked by the occupied wire. This preserves
    ordering and makes placement more intuitive.

    The ``wire_order`` keyword argument used by user facing functions like :func:`~.draw` maps position
    to wire label.   The ``wire_map`` keyword argument used here maps label to position.
    The utility function :func:`~.circuit_drawer.utils.convert_wire_order` can perform this
    transformation.
