    """Returns a function that computes the 'best' differentiation method
    for a particular QNode.

    This method prioritizes differentiation methods in the following order (SPSA-based and Hadamard-based gradients
    are not included here):

    * ``"device"``
    * ``"backprop"``
    * ``"parameter-shift"``

    .. note::

        The first differentiation method that is supported (from top to bottom)
        will be returned. The order is designed to maximize efficiency, generality,
        and stability.

    .. seealso::

        For a detailed comparison of the backpropagation and parameter-shift methods,
        refer to the :doc:`quantum gradients with backpropagation example <demo:demos/tutorial_backprop>`.

        qnode (.QNode): the qnode to get the 'best' differentiation method for.
