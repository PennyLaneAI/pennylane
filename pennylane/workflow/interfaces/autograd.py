This module contains functions for adding the Autograd interface
to a PennyLane Device class.

**How to bind a custom derivative with autograd.**

Suppose I have a function ``f`` that I want to change how autograd takes the derivative of.

I need to:

1) Mark it as an autograd primitive with ``@autograd.extend.primitive``
2) Register its VJP with ``autograd.extend.defvjp``

.. code-block:: python

    @autograd.extend.primitive
    def f(x, exponent=2):
        return x**exponent

    def vjp(ans, x, exponent=2):
        def grad_fn(dy):
            print(f"Calculating the gradient with {x}, {dy}")
            return dy * exponent * x**(exponent-1)
        return grad_fn

    autograd.extend.defvjp(f, vjp, argnums=[0])


>>> autograd.grad(f)(autograd.numpy.array(2.0))
Calculating the gradient with 2.0, 1.0
4.0

The above code told autograd how to differentiate the first argument of ``f``.

We have an additional problem that autograd does not understand that a :class:`~.QuantumTape`
contains parameters we want to differentiate. So in order to match the ``vjp`` function with
the correct parameters, we need to extract them from the batch of tapes, and pass them as is
as the first argument to the primitive. Even though the primitive function
does not use the parameters, that is how we communicate to autograd what parameters the derivatives
belong to.

**Jacobian Calculations and the need for caching:**

Suppose we use the above function with an array and take the jacobian:

>>> x = autograd.numpy.array([1.0, 2.0])
>>> autograd.jacobian(f)(x)
Calculating the gradient with [1. 2.], [1. 0.]
Calculating the gradient with [1. 2.], [0. 1.]
array([[2., 0.],
       [0., 4.]])

Here, the ``grad_fn`` was called once for each output quantity. Each time ``grad_fn``
is called, we are forced to reproduce the calculation for ``exponent * x ** (exponent-1)``,
only to multiply it by a different vector. When executing quantum circuits, that quantity
can potentially be quite expensive. Autograd would naively
request indepedent vjps for each entry in the output, even though the internal circuits will be
exactly the same.

When normal caching provided by :func:`~.cache_execute` is present, the expensive part (re-executing
identical circuits) is avoided, but when normal caching is turned off, the above can lead to an explosion
in the number of required circuit executions.

To avoid this explosion in the number of executed circuits when caching is turned off, we will instead internally
cache the full jacobian so that is is reused between different calls to the same ``grad_fn``. This behavior is toggled
by the ``cache_full_jacobian`` keyword argument to :class:`~.TransformJacobianProducts`.

Other interfaces are capable of calculating the full jacobian in one call, so this patch is only present for autograd.
