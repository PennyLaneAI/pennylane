class QueuingContext(abc.ABC):
    """Abstract base class for classes that exposes a queue for objects.

    In PennyLane, the construction of quantum gates is separated from the specific
    quantum node (:class:`~.BaseQNode`) that they belong to. However, including
    logic for this when creating an instance of :class:`~.Operator` does not align
    with the current architecture. Therefore, there is a need to use a high level
    object that holds information about the relationship between quantum gates and
    a quantum node.

    The :class:`~.QueuingContext` class realizes this by providing access to
    the current QNode.  Furthermore, it provides the flexibility to have
    multiple objects record the creation of quantum gates.

    The ``QueuingContext`` class both acts as the abstract base class for all
    classes that expose a queue for Operations (so-called contexts), as well as the
    interface to said queues. The active contexts contain maximally one QNode and
    an arbitrary number of other contexts like the :class:`~.OperationRecorder`.
