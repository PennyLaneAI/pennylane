    For :class:`~pennylane.S` operations, the measurements take on the four qubits out of a cluster(chain) state with five qubits and
    the corresponding measurements would be `X-basis`, `X-basis`, `Y-basis` and `X-basis`. The byproduct operator is $by_op = \sigma_x^{s_1+s_3}\sigma_z^{s_0+s_1+s_2+1}$

    `Fortran` convention used in the `Raussendorf et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301052>`__.

    For :class:`~pennylane.H` operations, the measurements take on the four qubits out of a cluster(chain) state with five qubits and
