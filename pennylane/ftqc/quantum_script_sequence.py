    circuit if the tapes included in it are executed in sequence (without resetting the device
    state), but only contains a single non-Clifford gate in each tape. This allows the
    Pauli tracker to flush its buffer before each non-Clifford gate.

    ..note ::
        This implementation pays no attention to wires/commutation, and therefore splits the tapes
        up more than necessary.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumScript or Callable): The quantum circuit to modify the mid-circuit measurements of.

    Returns:
        tuple[List[QuantumScriptSequence], function]: A new representation of the tape that contains multiple segments to be executed in order without resetting the device.

    We split the list of operations at each non-Clifford gate, while maintaining the
    operation order. The result is a list of lists, where a new sub-list begins each
    time a non-Clifford gate is encountered. Flattening this list of lists should result
    in the original list of operations.

    **Example**

    >>> ops = [RZ(1.2, 0), X(1), S(2), RotXZX(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 1), RZ(1.2, 2)]
