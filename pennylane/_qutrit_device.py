class QutritDevice(QubitDevice):  # pylint: disable=too-many-public-methods
    """Abstract base class for PennyLane qutrit devices.

    The following abstract method **must** be defined:

    * :meth:`~.apply`: append circuit operations, compile the circuit (if applicable),
      and perform the quantum computation.

    Devices that generate their own samples (such as hardware) may optionally
    overwrite :meth:`~.probability`. This method otherwise automatically
    computes the probabilities from the generated samples, and **must**
    overwrite the following method:

    * :meth:`~.generate_samples`: Generate samples from the device from the
      exact or approximate probability distribution.

    Analytic devices **must** overwrite the following method:

    * :meth:`~.analytic_probability`: returns the probability or marginal probability from the
      device after circuit execution. :meth:`~.marginal_prob` may be used here.

    This device contains common utility methods for qutrit-based devices. These
    do not need to be overwritten. Utility methods include:

    * :meth:`~.expval`, :meth:`~.var`, :meth:`~.sample`: return expectation values,
      variances, and samples of observables after the circuit has been rotated
      into the observable eigenbasis.

    Args:
        wires (int, Iterable[Number, str]]): Number of subsystems represented by the device,
            or iterable that contains unique labels for the subsystems as numbers (i.e., ``[-1, 0, 2]``)
            or strings (``['ancilla', 'q1', 'q2']``). Default 1 if not specified.
        shots (None, int, list[int]): Number of circuit evaluations/random samples used to estimate
            expectation values of observables. If ``None``, the device calculates probability, expectation values,
            and variances analytically. If an integer, it specifies the number of samples to estimate these quantities.
            If a list of integers is passed, the circuit evaluations are batched over the list of shots.
        r_dtype: Real floating point precision type.
        c_dtype: Complex floating point precision type.
