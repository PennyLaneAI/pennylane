def spectrum(qnode):
    r"""Create a function that computes the frequency spectra of the qnode
    with respect to all differentiable inputs.

    If the circuit represented by the qnode returns the expectation value of an
    observable, it can be interpreted as a function
    :math:`f: \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`. This function can always be
    expressed by a Fourier series

    .. math::

        \sum \limits_{n_1\in \Omega_1} \dots \sum \limits_{n_N \in \Omega_N}
        c_{n_1,\dots, n_N} e^{-i x_1 n_1} \dots e^{-i x_N n_N}

    summing over the *frequency spectra* :math:`\Omega_i \subseteq \mathbb{Z},`
    :math:`i=1,\dots,N`, where :math:`\mathbb{Z}` are the integers. Each
    spectrum has the property that :math:`0 \in \Omega_i`, and the spectrum is
    symmetric (for every :math:`n \in \Omega_i` we have that :math:`-n \in
    \Omega_i`).

    As shown in `Vidal and Theis (2019)
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11434>`_ and `Schuld, Sweke and Meyer (2020)
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08605>`_, if an input :math:`x_j, j = 1 \dots N`
    only enters into single-parameter gates of the form :math:`e^{-i x_j G}`, the
    frequency spectrum :math:`\Omega_j` is fully determined by the eigenvalues
    of the generators :math:`G`. In many situations, the spectra are limited
    to a few frequencies only, which in turn limits the function class that the circuit
    can express.

    Arguments to the qnode are marked as inputs :math:`x_1, \dots, x_N` by making them
    differentiable.

    .. note::
        Differentiability of the inputs is not used here to compute
        gradients, but to track inputs through classical
        pre-processing and circuit compilation procedures.

    Args:
        qnode (pennylane.QNode): a quantum node that has been called with some inputs

    Returns:
        (Dict[pennylane.numpy.tensor, list[float]]): Dictionary of scalar inputs as keys, and
        their frequency spectra as values.
