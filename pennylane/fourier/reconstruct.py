    **Example**

    Consider the following QNode:

    .. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x, Y):
            qml.RX(x, wires=0)
            qml.RY(Y[0], wires=0)
            qml.RY(Y[1], wires=1)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            qml.RY(5*  Y[1], wires=1)
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1))

        x = 0.4
        Y = np.array([1.9, -0.5])
        f = 2.3

        circuit_value = circuit(x, Y)

    It has three variational parameters ``x`` (a scalar) and two entries of ``Y``
    (an array-like).
    A reconstruction job could then be with respect to the two entries of ``Y``,
    which enter the circuit with one and six integer frequencies, respectively
    (see the additional examples below for details on how to obtain the frequency
    spectrum if it is not known):

    >>> nums_frequency = {"Y": {(0,): 1, (1,): 6}}
    >>> with qml.Tracker(circuit.device) as tracker:
    ...     rec = qml.fourier.reconstruct(circuit, {"Y": [(0,), (1,)]}, nums_frequency)(x, Y)
    >>> rec.keys()
    dict_keys(['Y'])
    >>> print(*rec["Y"].items(), sep="\n")
    ((0,), <function _reconstruct_equ.<locals>._reconstruction at 0x7fbd685aee50>)
    ((1,), <function _reconstruct_equ.<locals>._reconstruction at 0x7fbd6866eee0>)
    >>> recon_Y0 = rec["Y"][(0,)]
    >>> recon_Y1 = rec["Y"][(1,)]
    >>> np.isclose(recon_Y0(Y[0]), circuit_value)
    True
    >>> np.isclose(recon_Y1(Y[1]+1.3), circuit(x, Y+np.eye(2)[1]*1.3))
    True

    We successfully reconstructed the dependence on the two entries of ``Y`` ,
    keeping ``x`` and the respective other entry in ``Y`` at their initial values.
    Let us also see how many executions of the device were used to obtain the
    reconstructions:

    >>> tracker.totals

    The example above used that we already knew the frequency spectra of the
    QNode of interest. However, this is in general not the case and we may need
    to compute the spectrum first. This can be done with
    :func:`.fourier.qnode_spectrum` :

    >>> spectra = qml.fourier.qnode_spectrum(circuit)(x, Y)
    >>> spectra.keys()
    dict_keys(['x', 'Y'])
    >>> spectra["x"]
    {(): [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]}
    >>> print(*spectra["Y"].items(), sep="\n")
    ((0,), [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0])
    ((1,), [-6.0, -5.0, -4.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0])

    the usage details section below.

        :title: Usage Details

        **Input formatting**

        As described briefly above, the essential inputs to ``reconstruct`` that provide information
        about the QNode are given as dictionaries of dictionaries, where the outer keys reference
        the argument names of ``qnode`` and the inner keys reference the parameter indices within
        each array-valued QNode argument. These parameter indices always are tuples, so that
        for scalar-valued QNode parameters, the parameter index is ``()`` by convention and the
        ``i`` -th parameter of a one-dimensional array can be accessed via ``(i,)`` .
        For example, providing ``nums_frequency``

        - for a scalar argument: ``nums_frequency = {"x": {(): 4}}``
        - for a one-dimensional argument: ``nums_frequency = {"Y": {(0,): 2, (1,): 9, (4,): 1}}``
        - for a three-dimensional argument: ``nums_frequency = {"Z": {(0, 2, 5): 2, (1, 1, 4): 1}}``

        This applies to ``nums_frequency`` , ``spectra`` , and ``shifts`` .

        Note that the information provided in ``nums_frequency`` / ``spectra`` is essential for
        the correctness of the reconstruction.

        On the other hand, the input format for ``ids`` is flexible and allows a collection of
        parameter indices for each QNode argument name (as a ``dict`` ), a collection of argument
        names (as a ``list``, ``set``, ``tuple`` or similar), or a single argument name
        (as a ``str`` ) to be defined. For ``ids=None`` , all argument names contained in
        ``nums_frequency`` -- or ``spectra`` if ``nums_frequency`` is not used -- are considered.
        For inputs that do not specify parameter indices per QNode argument name (all formats but
        ``dict`` ), these parameter indices are inferred from ``nums_frequency`` / ``spectra`` .

        **Reconstruction cost**

        The reconstruction cost -- in terms of calls to ``qnode`` -- depend on the number of
        frequencies given via ``nums_frequency`` or ``spectra`` . A univariate reconstruction
        for :math:`R` frequencies takes :math:`2R+1` evaluations. If multiple univariate
        reconstructions are performed at the same point with various numbers of frequencies
        :math:`R_k` , the cost are :math:`1+2\sum_k R_k` if the shift :math:`0` is used in all
        of them. This is in particular the case if ``nums_frequency`` or ``spectra`` with
        ``shifts=None`` is used.

        If the number of frequencies is too large or the given frequency spectrum contains
        more than the spectrum of ``qnode`` , the reconstruction is performed suboptimally
        but remains correct.
        For integer-valued spectra with gaps, the equidistant reconstruction is thus suboptimal
        and the non-equidistant version method be used (also see the examples below).

        **Numerical stability**

        In general, the reconstruction with equidistant shifts for equidistant frequencies
        (used if ``nums_frequency`` is provided) is more stable numerically than the more
        general Fourier reconstruction (used if ``nums_frequency=None`` ).
        If the system of equations to be solved in the Fourier transform is
        ill-conditioned, a warning is raised as the output might become unstable.
        Examples for this are shift values or frequencies that lie very close to each other.

        **Differentiability**

        The returned scalar functions are differentiable in all interfaces with respect
        to their scalar input variable. They expect these inputs to be in the same
        interface as the one used by the QNode. More advanced differentiability, for example
        of the reconstructions with respect to QNode properties, is not supported
        reliably yet.

        .. warning::

            When using ``TensorFlow`` or ``Autograd`` *and* ``nums_frequency`` ,
            the reconstructed functions are not differentiable at the point of
            reconstruction. One workaround for this is to use ``spectra`` as
            input instead and to thereby use the Fourier transform instead of
            Dirichlet kernels. Alternatively, the original QNode evaluation can
            be used.

        **More examples**

        Consider the QNode from the example above, now with an additional, tunable frequency
        ``f`` for the Pauli-X rotation that is controlled by ``x`` :

        .. code-block:: python

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(x, Y, f=1.0):
                qml.RX(f * x, wires=0)
                qml.RY(Y[0], wires=0)
                qml.RY(Y[1], wires=1)
                qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
                qml.RY(5*  Y[1], wires=1)
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1))

            f = 2.3

            circuit_value = circuit(x, Y)


        We repeat the reconstruction job for the dependence on ``Y[1]`` .
        Note that even though information about ``Y[0]`` is contained in ``nums_frequency`` ,
        ``ids`` determines which reconstructions are performed.

        >>> with qml.Tracker(circuit.device) as tracker:
        ...     rec = qml.fourier.reconstruct(circuit, {"Y": [(1,)]}, nums_frequency)(x, Y)
        >>> tracker.totals
        {'executions': 13}

        As expected, we required :math:`2R+1=2\cdot 6+1=13` circuit executions. However, not
        all frequencies below :math:`f_\text{max}=6` are present in the circuit, so that
        a reconstruction using knowledge of the full frequency spectrum will be cheaper:

        >>> spectra = {"Y": {(1,): [0., 1., 4., 5., 6.]}}
        >>> with tracker:
        ...     rec = qml.fourier.reconstruct(circuit, {"Y": [(1,)]}, None, spectra)(x, Y)
        >>> tracker.totals
        {'executions': 9}

        We again obtain the full univariate dependence on ``Y[1]`` but with considerably
        fewer executions on the quantum device.
        Once we obtained the classical function that describes the dependence, no
        additional circuit evaluations are performed:

        >>> with tracker:
        ...     for Y1 in np.arange(-np.pi, np.pi, 20):
        ...         rec["Y"][(1,)](-2.1)
        >>> tracker.totals
        {}

        If we want to reconstruct the dependence of ``circuit`` on ``x`` , we cannot use
        ``nums_frequency`` if ``f`` is not an integer. One could rescale ``x`` to obtain
        the frequency :math:`1` again, or directly use ``spectra`` . We will combine the
        latter with another reconstruction with respect to ``Y[0]`` :

        >>> spectra = {"x": {(): [0., f]}, "Y": {(0,): [0., 1.]}}
        >>> with tracker:
        ...     rec = qml.fourier.reconstruct(circuit, None, None, spectra)(x, Y, f=f)
        >>> tracker.totals
        {'executions': 5}
        >>> recon_x = rec["x"][()]
        >>> np.isclose(recon_x(x+0.5), circuit(x+0.5, Y, f=f)
        True

        Note that by convention, the parameter index for a scalar variable is ``()`` and
        that the frequency :math:`0` always needs to be included in the spectra.
        Furthermore, we here skipped the input ``ids`` so that the reconstruction
        was performed for all keys in ``spectra`` .
        The reconstruction with a single non-zero frequency
        costs three evaluations of ``circuit`` for each, ``x`` and ``Y[0]`` . Performing
        both reconstructions at the same position allowed us to save one of the
        evaluations and reduce the number of calls to :math:`5`.
