@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Resources:
    r"""Contains attributes which store key resources such as number of gates, number of wires, shots,
    depth and gate types.

    Args:
        num_wires (int): number of qubits
        num_gates (int): number of gates
        gate_types (dict): dictionary storing operation names (str) as keys
            and the number of times they are used in the circuit (int) as values
        depth (int): the depth of the circuit defined as the maximum number of non-parallel operations
        shots (int): number of samples to generate

    .. details::

        The resources being tracked can be accessed as class attributes.
        Additionally, the :code:`Resources` instance can be nicely displayed in the console.

        **Example**

        >>> r = Resources(num_wires=2, num_gates=2, gate_types={'Hadamard': 1, 'CNOT':1}, depth=2)
        >>> print(r)
        wires: 2
        gates: 2
        depth: 2
        shots: 0
        gate_types: {'Hadamard': 1, 'CNOT': 1}
