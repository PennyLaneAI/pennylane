from numbers import Number


class Tracker:
    """This class stores information about device executions and allows users to interact with that
    data upon individual executions and batches, even within parameter-shift gradients and
    optimization steps.

    The information is stored in three class attribute dictionaries: ``totals``, ``history``,
    and ``latest``:

    * ``latest`` tracks the last set of information passed to the tracker.
    * ``history`` stores a list of values passed for each keyword.
    * ``totals`` keeps a running sum per keyword when the values are numeric.

    Standard devices will track the number of executions, number of shots, number of batch
    executions, batch execution length, and results of circuit executions, but plugins may store
    additional information with no changes to this class.

    Information is only stored when the class attribute ``active`` is set to ``True``. This
    attribute can be toggled via a context manager and Python's ``with`` statement. Upon entering a
    context, the stored information is reset, unless ``persistent=True``. Tracking mode can also be
    manually triggered by setting ``tracker.active = True`` without the use of a context manager.

    Args:
        dev (Device): A PennyLane compatible device
        callback=None (callable or None): A function of the keywords ``totals``,
            ``history`` and ``latest``.  Run on each ``record`` call with current values of
            the corresponding attributes.
        persistent=False (bool): Whether to reset stored information upon
            entering a runtime context.


    **Example**

    Using a ``with`` statement to toggle the active mode, we can see the number of executions
    and shots used to calculate a parameter-shift derivative.

    .. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=1, shots=100)

        @qml.qnode(dev, diff_method="parameter-shift")
        def circuit(x):
            qml.RX(x, wires=0)
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

        x = np.array(0.1, requires_grad=True)

        with qml.Tracker(dev) as tracker:
            qml.grad(circuit)(x)

    You can then access the tabulated information through ``totals``, ``history``, and ``latest``:

    >>> tracker.totals
    {'batches': 2, 'simulations': 3, 'executions': 3, 'shots': 300}
    >>> tracker.latest
    {'simulations': 1,
     'executions': 1,
     'results': array(-0.08),
     'shots': 100,
     'resources': Resources(num_wires=1, num_gates=1,
                            gate_types=defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'RX': 1}),
                            gate_sizes=defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {1: 1}),
                            depth=1,
                            shots=Shots(total_shots=100, shot_vector=(ShotCopies(100 shots x 1),)))}
    >>> tracker.history.keys()
    dict_keys(['batches', 'simulations', 'executions', 'results', 'shots', 'resources'])
    >>> tracker.history['results']
    [array(1.), array(0.02), array(-0.08)]
    >>> print(tracker.history['resources'][0])
    wires: 1
    gates: 1
    depth: 1
    shots: Shots(total=100)
    gate_types:
    {'RX': 1}
    gate_sizes:
    {1: 1}

    We can see that calculating the gradient of ``circuit`` takes three total evaluations: one
    forward pass and one batch of length two for the derivative of ``qml.RX``.

    .. details::
        :title: Usage Details

        .. note::
            With backpropagation, this function should take ``qnode.device``
            instead of the device used to create the QNode.

        Users can pass a custom callback function to the ``callback`` keyword. This
        function is run each time the ``record()`` method is called, which occurs near
        the end of a device's ``execute`` and ``batch_execute`` methods. Using ``print``
        or logging, users can monitor completion during a long set of jobs.

        The function passed must accept ``totals``, ``history``, and ``latest`` as
        keyword arguments. The dictionary ``latest`` will contain different keywords based on whether
        whether ``execute`` or ``batch_execute`` last performed an update.

        >>> def shots_info(totals, history, latest):
        ...     if 'shots' in latest:
        ...         print("Total shots: ", totals['shots'])
        >>> x = np.array(0.1, requires_grad=True)
        >>> with qml.Tracker(circuit.device, callback=shots_info) as tracker:
        ...     qml.grad(circuit)(x)
        Total shots:  100
        Total shots:  200
        Total shots:  300

        By specifying ``persistent=False``, you can reuse the same tracker across
        multiple contexts.

        >>> with qml.Tracker(circuit.device, persistent=False) as tracker:
        ...     circuit(0.1)
        >>> with tracker:
        ...     circuit(0.2)
        >>> tracker.totals['executions']
        2

        When used with the null qubit device (eg. ``dev = qml.device("null.qubit")``), we can track the resources
        used in the circuit without execution!

        >>> dev = qml.device("null.qubit", wires=[0], shots=10)
        >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
        ... def circuit(x):
        ...     qml.RX(x, wires=0)
        ...     return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
        ...
        >>> with qml.Tracker(dev) as tracker:
        ...     circuit(0.1)
        ...
        >>> resources_lst = tracker.history['resources']
        >>> print(resources_lst[0])
        wires: 1
        gates: 1
        depth: 1
        shots: Shots(total=10)
        gate_types:
        {"RX": 1}
        gate_sizes:
        {1: 1}
