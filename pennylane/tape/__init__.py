    Tape mode is an experimental new mode of PennyLane. QNodes created in tape mode have support for
    in-QNode classical processing, differentiable quantum decompositions, returning the quantum
    state, less restrictive QNode signatures, and various other improvements.

    For more details on tape mode, see :mod:`pennylane.tape`.

    **Example**

    Simply call this function at the beginning of your script or session.

    >>> qml.enable_tape()

    All subsequent QNodes will be created using tape mode, and can take
    advantage of the various tape mode features:
