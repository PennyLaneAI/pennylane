    r"""Quantum tape for computing gradients via reversible analytic differentiation.

    .. note::

        The reversible analytic differentiation method has the following restrictions:

        * As it requires knowledge of the statevector, only statevector simulator devices can be used.

        * Differentiation is only supported for the parametrized quantum operations
          :class:`~.RX`, :class:`~.RY`, :class:`~.RZ`, and :class:`~.Rot`.

    This class extends the :class:`~.jacobian` method of the quantum tape to support analytic
    gradients of qubit operations using reversible analytic differentiation. This gradient method
    returns *exact* gradients, however requires use of a statevector simulator. Simply create
    the tape, and then call the Jacobian method:

    >>> tape.jacobian(dev)

    For more details on the quantum tape, please see :class:`~.JacobianTape`.

    **Reversible analytic differentiation**

    Assume a circuit has a gate :math:`G(\theta)` that we want to differentiate.
    Without loss of generality, we can write the circuit in the form three unitaries: :math:`UGV`.
    Starting from the initial state :math:`\vert 0\rangle`, the quantum state is evolved up to the
    "pre-measurement" state :math:`\vert\psi\rangle=UGV\vert 0\rangle`, which is saved
    (this can be reused for each variable being differentiated).

    We then apply the unitary :math:`V^{-1}` to evolve this state backwards in time
    until just after the gate :math:`G` (hence the name "reversible").
    The generator of :math:`G` is then applied as a gate, and we evolve forward using :math:`V` again.
    At this stage, the state of the simulator is proportional to
    :math:`\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\vert\psi\rangle`.
    Some further post-processing of this gives the derivative
    :math:`\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} \langle \hat{O} \rangle` for any observable O.

    The reversible approach is similar to backpropagation, but trades off extra computation for
    enhanced memory efficiency. Where backpropagation caches the state tensors at each step during
    a forward pass, the reversible method only caches the final pre-measurement state.

    Compared to the parameter-shift rule, the reversible method can
    be faster or slower, depending on the density and location of parametrized gates in a circuit
    (circuits with higher density of parametrized gates near the end of the circuit will see a
    benefit).
