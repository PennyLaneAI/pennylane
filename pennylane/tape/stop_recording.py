def stop_recording():
    """A context manager and decorator to ensure that contained logic is non-recordable
    or non-queueable within a QNode or quantum tape context.

    **Example**

    Consider the following quantum function:

    >>> def list_of_ops(params, wires):
    ...     return [
    ...         qml.RX(params[0], wires=wires),
    ...         qml.RY(params[1], wires=wires),
    ...         qml.RZ(params[2], wires=wires)
    ...     ]

    If executed within a QNode or a tape context, these operations will be
    recorded, even if this is not the intention:

    >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)
    >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
    ... def circuit(params):
    ...     ops = list_of_ops(params, wires=0)
    ...     qml.apply(ops[-1])  # apply only the last operation from the list
    ...     return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)([1, 2, 3]))
     0: ──RX(1)──RY(2)──RZ(3)──┤ ⟨Z⟩

    Using the ``stop_recording`` context manager, all logic
    contained within is not queued or recorded by the QNode:

    >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
    ... def circuit(params):
    ...     with stop_recording():
    ...         ops = list_of_ops(params, wires=0)
    ...     qml.apply(ops[-1])
    ...     return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)([1, 2, 3]))
     0: ──RZ(3)──┤ ⟨Z⟩

    ``stop_recording`` can also be used as a decorator. Decorated
    functions, when executed, will inhibit any internal
    quantum operation processing from being recorded by the QNode:

    >>> @stop_recording()
    ... def list_of_ops(params, wires):
    ...     return [
    ...         qml.RX(params[0], wires=wires),
    ...         qml.RY(params[1], wires=wires),
    ...         qml.RZ(params[2], wires=wires)
    ...     ]
    >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
    ... def circuit(params):
    ...     ops = list_of_ops(params, wires=0)
    ...     qml.apply(ops[-1])
    ...     return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)([1, 2, 3]))
     0: ──RZ(3)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
    """
    tape = get_active_tape()

    if tape is None:
        yield
        return

    with tape.stop_recording():
        yield

    return
