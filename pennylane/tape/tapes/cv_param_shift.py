    r"""Quantum tape for CV parameter-shift analytic differentiation method.

    This class extends the :class:`~.jacobian` method of the quantum tape
    to support analytic gradients of Gaussian CV operations using the parameter-shift rule.
    This gradient method returns *exact* gradients, and can be computed directly
    on quantum hardware. Simply pass ``method=analytic`` when computing the Jacobian:

    >>> tape.jacobian(dev, method="analytic")

    For more details on the quantum tape, please see :class:`~.JacobianTape`.

    This tape supports analytic gradients of photonic circuits that satisfy
    the following constraints with regards to measurements:

    * Expectation values are restricted to observables that are first- and
      second-order in :math:`\hat{x}` :math:`\hat{p}` only.
      This includes :class:`~.X`, :class:`~.P`, :class:`~.QuadOperator`,
      :class:`~.PolyXP`, and :class:`~.NumberOperator`.

      For second-order observables, the device **must support** :class:`~.PolyXP`.

    * Variances are restricted to observables that are first-order
      in :math:`\hat{x}` :math:`\hat{p}` only. This includes :class:`~.X`, :class:`~.P`,
      :class:`~.QuadOperator`, and *some* parameter values of :class:`~.PolyXP`.

      The device **must support** :class:`~.PolyXP`.

    Fock state probabilities (tapes that return :func:`~pennylane.probs` or
    expectation values of :class:`~.FockStateProjector`) are not supported.

    In addition, the tape operations must fulfill the following requirements:

    * Only Gaussian operations are differentiable.

    * Non-differentiable Fock states and Fock operations may *precede* all differentiable Gaussian,
      operations. For example, the following is permissible:

      .. code-block:: python

          with CVParamShiftTape() as tape:
              # Non-differentiable Fock operations
              qml.FockState(2, wires=0)
              qml.Kerr(0.654, wires=1)

              # differentiable Gaussian operations
              qml.Displacement(0.6, wires=0)
              qml.Displacement(0.6, 0.5, wires=0)
              qml.Beamsplitter(0.5, 0.1, wires=[0, 1])
              expval(qml.NumberOperator(0))

          tape.trainable_params = {2, 3, 4}

    * If a Fock operation succeeds a Gaussian operation, the Fock operation must
      not contribute to any measurements. For example, the following is allowed:

      .. code-block:: python

          with CVParamShiftTape() as tape:
              qml.Displacement(0.6, wires=0)
              qml.Beamsplitter(0.5, 0.1, wires=[0, 1])
              qml.Kerr(0.654, wires=1)  # there is no measurement on wire 1
              expval(qml.NumberOperator(0))

          tape.trainable_params = {0, 1, 2}

    If any of the above constraints are not followed, the tape cannot be differentiated
    via the CV parameter-shift rule. Please use numerical differentiation instead:

    >>> tape.jacobian(dev, method="numeric")
