def get_jax_interface_name(tapes):
    """Check all parameters in each tape and output the name of the suitable
    JAX interface.

    This function checks each tape and determines if any of the gate parameters
    was transformed by a JAX transform such as ``jax.jit``. If so, it outputs
    the name of the JAX interface with jit support.

    Note that determining if jit support should be turned on is done by
    checking if parameters are abstract. Parameters can be abstract not just
    for ``jax.jit``, but for other JAX transforms (vmap, pmap, etc.) too. The
    reason is that JAX doesn't have a public API for checking whether or not
    the execution is within the jit transform.
