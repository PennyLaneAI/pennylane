            If ``jacobians`` is an empty list, then ``gradient_fn`` is used to
            compute the gradients during the backwards pass.

        _n (int): a positive integer used to track nesting of derivatives, for example
            if the nth-order derivative is requested.
        max_diff (int): If ``gradient_fn`` is a gradient transform, this option specifies
            the maximum order of derivatives to support. Increasing this value allows
            for higher order derivatives to be extracted, at the cost of additional
            (classical) computational overhead during the backwards pass.
        mode (str): Whether the gradients should be computed on the forward
            pass (``forward``) or the backward pass (``backward``).
