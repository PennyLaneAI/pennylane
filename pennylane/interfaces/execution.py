      added to the cache.

    - If a tape matches a hash in the cache, then the tape has been previously

    during the project. The current version is supporting forward execution for Numpy and does not support shot vectors.

    Args:
        tapes (Sequence[.QuantumTape]): batch of tapes to execute
        device (.Device): Device to use to execute the batch of tapes.
            If the device does not provide a ``batch_execute`` method,
            by default the tapes will be executed in serial.
        gradient_fn (None or callable): The gradient transform function to use
            for backward passes. If "device", the device will be queried directly
            for the gradient (if supported).
        interface (str): The interface that will be used for classical autodifferentiation.
            This affects the types of parameters that can exist on the input tapes.
            Available options include ``autograd``, ``torch``, ``tf``, ``jax`` and ``auto``.
        mode (str): Whether the gradients should be computed on the forward
            pass (``forward``) or the backward pass (``backward``). Only applies
            if the device is queried for the gradient; gradient transform
            functions available in ``qml.gradients`` are only supported on the backward
            pass.
        gradient_kwargs (dict): dictionary of keyword arguments to pass when
            determining the gradients of tapes
        cache (bool): Whether to cache evaluations. This can result in
            a significant reduction in quantum evaluations during gradient computations.
        cachesize (int): the size of the cache
        max_diff (int): If ``gradient_fn`` is a gradient transform, this option specifies
            the maximum number of derivatives to support. Increasing this value allows
            for higher order derivatives to be extracted, at the cost of additional
            (classical) computational overhead during the backwards pass.
        override_shots (int): The number of shots to use for the execution. If ``False``, then the
            number of shots on the device is used.
        expand_fn (function): Tape expansion function to be called prior to device execution.
            Must have signature of the form ``expand_fn(tape, max_expansion)``, and return a
            single :class:`~.QuantumTape`. If not provided, by default :meth:`Device.expand_fn`
            is called.
        max_expansion (int): The number of times the internal circuit should be expanded when
            executed on a device. Expansion occurs when an operation or measurement is not
            supported, and results in a gate decomposition. If any operations in the decomposition
            remain unsupported by the device, another expansion occurs.
        device_batch_transform (bool): Whether to apply any batch transforms defined by the device
            (within :meth:`Device.batch_transform`) to each tape to be executed. The default behaviour
            of the device batch transform is to expand out Hamiltonian measurements into
            constituent terms if not supported on the device.

    Returns:
        list[tensor_like[float]]: A nested list of tape results. Each element in
        the returned list corresponds in order to the provided tapes.

    **Example**

    Consider the following cost function:

    .. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

        def cost_fn(params, x):
            with qml.tape.QuantumTape() as tape1:
                qml.RX(params[0], wires=0)
                qml.RY(params[1], wires=0)
                qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

            with qml.tape.QuantumTape() as tape2:
                qml.RX(params[2], wires=0)
                qml.RY(x[0], wires=1)
                qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
                qml.probs(wires=0)

            tapes = [tape1, tape2]

            # execute both tapes in a batch on the given device
            res = qml.execute(tapes, dev, gradient_fn=qml.gradients.param_shift, max_diff=2)

            return res[0] + res[1][0] - res[1][1]

    In this cost function, two **independent** quantum tapes are being
    constructed; one returning an expectation value, the other probabilities.
    We then batch execute the two tapes, and reduce the results to obtain
    a scalar.

    Let's execute this cost function while tracking the gradient:

    >>> params = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], requires_grad=True)
    >>> x = np.array([0.5], requires_grad=True)
    >>> cost_fn(params, x)
    1.93050682

    Since the ``execute`` function is differentiable, we can
    also compute the gradient:

    >>> qml.grad(cost_fn)(params, x)
    (array([-0.0978434 , -0.19767681, -0.29552021]), array([5.37764278e-17]))

    Finally, we can also compute any nth-order derivative. Let's compute the Jacobian
    of the gradient (that is, the Hessian):

    >>> x.requires_grad = False
    >>> qml.jacobian(qml.grad(cost_fn))(params, x)
    array([[-0.97517033,  0.01983384,  0.        ],
           [ 0.01983384, -0.97517033,  0.        ],
           [ 0.        ,  0.        , -0.95533649]])

    """Execute a batch of tapes on a device in an autodifferentiable-compatible manner.

    Args:
        tapes (Sequence[.QuantumTape]): batch of tapes to execute
        device (.Device): Device to use to execute the batch of tapes.
            If the device does not provide a ``batch_execute`` method,
            by default the tapes will be executed in serial.
        gradient_fn (None or callable): The gradient transform function to use
            for backward passes. If "device", the device will be queried directly
            for the gradient (if supported).
        interface (str): The interface that will be used for classical autodifferentiation.
            This affects the types of parameters that can exist on the input tapes.
            Available options include ``autograd``, ``torch``, ``tf``, ``jax`` and ``auto``.
        mode (str): Whether the gradients should be computed on the forward
            pass (``forward``) or the backward pass (``backward``). Only applies
            if the device is queried for the gradient; gradient transform
            functions available in ``qml.gradients`` are only supported on the backward
            pass.
        gradient_kwargs (dict): dictionary of keyword arguments to pass when
            determining the gradients of tapes
        cache (bool): Whether to cache evaluations. This can result in
            a significant reduction in quantum evaluations during gradient computations.
        cachesize (int): the size of the cache
        max_diff (int): If ``gradient_fn`` is a gradient transform, this option specifies
            the maximum number of derivatives to support. Increasing this value allows
            for higher order derivatives to be extracted, at the cost of additional
            (classical) computational overhead during the backwards pass.
        override_shots (int): The number of shots to use for the execution. If ``False``, then the
            number of shots on the device is used.
        expand_fn (function): Tape expansion function to be called prior to device execution.
            Must have signature of the form ``expand_fn(tape, max_expansion)``, and return a
            single :class:`~.QuantumTape`. If not provided, by default :meth:`Device.expand_fn`
            is called.
        max_expansion (int): The number of times the internal circuit should be expanded when
            executed on a device. Expansion occurs when an operation or measurement is not
            supported, and results in a gate decomposition. If any operations in the decomposition
            remain unsupported by the device, another expansion occurs.
        device_batch_transform (bool): Whether to apply any batch transforms defined by the device
            (within :meth:`Device.batch_transform`) to each tape to be executed. The default behaviour
            of the device batch transform is to expand out Hamiltonian measurements into
            constituent terms if not supported on the device.

    Returns:
        list[tensor_like[float]]: A nested list of tape results. Each element in
        the returned list corresponds in order to the provided tapes.

    **Example**

    Consider the following cost function:

    .. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

        def cost_fn(params, x):
            with qml.tape.QuantumTape() as tape1:
                qml.RX(params[0], wires=0)
                qml.RY(params[1], wires=0)
                qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

            with qml.tape.QuantumTape() as tape2:
                qml.RX(params[2], wires=0)
                qml.RY(x[0], wires=1)
                qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
                qml.probs(wires=0)

            tapes = [tape1, tape2]

            # execute both tapes in a batch on the given device
            res = qml.execute(tapes, dev, qml.gradients.param_shift, max_diff=2)

            return res[0][0] + res[1][0, 0] - res[1][0, 1]

    In this cost function, two **independent** quantum tapes are being
    constructed; one returning an expectation value, the other probabilities.
    We then batch execute the two tapes, and reduce the results to obtain
    a scalar.

    Let's execute this cost function while tracking the gradient:

    >>> params = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], requires_grad=True)
    >>> x = np.array([0.5], requires_grad=True)
    >>> cost_fn(params, x)
    tensor(1.93050682, requires_grad=True)

    Since the ``execute`` function is differentiable, we can
    also compute the gradient:

    >>> qml.grad(cost_fn)(params, x)
    (array([-0.0978434 , -0.19767681, -0.29552021]), array([5.37764278e-17]))

    Finally, we can also compute any nth-order derivative. Let's compute the Jacobian
    of the gradient (that is, the Hessian):

    >>> x.requires_grad = False
    >>> qml.jacobian(qml.grad(cost_fn))(params, x)
    array([[-0.97517033,  0.01983384,  0.        ],
           [ 0.01983384, -0.97517033,  0.        ],
           [ 0.        ,  0.        , -0.95533649]])
