.. currentmodule:: pennylane

This module implements the infrastructure for PennyLane's new graph-based decomposition system.

.. warning::

    This module is experimental and is subject to change in the future.

To activate and deactivate the new experimental graph-based decomposition system, use the switches
:func:`~pennylane.decomposition.enable_graph` and :func:`~pennylane.decomposition.disable_graph`. Whether the graph-based
decomposition system is currently being used can be queried with :func:`~pennylane.decomposition.enabled_graph`.
By default, this system is disabled.

.. currentmodule:: pennylane.decomposition

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~enable_graph
    ~disable_graph
    ~enabled_graph

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import pennylane as qml
    >>> qml.decomposition.enabled_graph()
    False
    >>> qml.decomposition.enable_graph()
    >>> qml.decomposition.enabled_graph()
    True
    >>> qml.decomposition.disable_graph()
    >>> qml.decomposition.enabled_graph()
    False

.. _decomps_rules:

Defining Decomposition Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. currentmodule:: pennylane.decomposition

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~register_resources
    ~resource_rep
    ~controlled_resource_rep
    ~adjoint_resource_rep
    ~pow_resource_rep
    ~DecompositionRule
    ~Resources
    ~CompressedResourceOp

In the new decomposition system, a decomposition rule must be defined as a quantum function that
accepts ``(*op.parameters, op.wires, **op.hyperparameters)`` as arguments, where ``op`` is an
instance of the operator type that the decomposition is for. Additionally, a decomposition rule
must declare its resource requirements using the ``register_resources`` decorator:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml

    @qml.register_resources({qml.H: 2, qml.CZ: 1})
    def my_cnot(wires):
        qml.H(wires=wires[1])
        qml.CZ(wires=wires)
        qml.H(wires=wires[1])

.. _decomps_management:

Inspecting and Managing Decomposition Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~add_decomps
    ~list_decomps
    ~has_decomp

PennyLane maintains a global dictionary of decomposition rules. New decomposition rules can be
registered under an operator using ``add_decomps``, and ``list_decomps`` can be called to inspect
a list of known decomposition rules for a given operator. In the new system, an operator can be
associated with multiple decomposition rules, and the one that leads to the most resource-efficient
decomposition towards a target gate set is chosen.

Integration with the Decompose Transform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :func:`~pennylane.transforms.decompose` transform takes advantage of this new graph-based
decomposition algorithm when :func:`~pennylane.decomposition.enable_graph` is present, and allows for more
flexible decompositions towards any target gate set. For example, the current system does not
guarantee a decomposition to the desired target gate set:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml

    with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
        qml.CRX(0.5, wires=[0, 1])

    tape = qml.tape.QuantumScript.from_queue(q)
    [new_tape], _ = qml.transforms.decompose([tape], gate_set={"RX", "RY", "RZ", "CZ"})

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> new_tape.operations
    [RZ(1.5707963267948966, wires=[1]),
     RY(0.25, wires=[1]),
     CNOT(wires=[0, 1]),
     RY(-0.25, wires=[1]),
     CNOT(wires=[0, 1]),
     RZ(-1.5707963267948966, wires=[1])]

With the new system enabled, the transform produces the expected outcome.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> qml.decomposition.enable_graph()
    >>> [new_tape], _ = qml.transforms.decompose([tape], gate_set={"RX", "RY", "RZ", "CZ"})
    >>> new_tape.operations
    [RX(0.25, wires=[1]), CZ(wires=[0, 1]), RX(-0.25, wires=[1]), CZ(wires=[0, 1])]

**Customizing Decompositions**

The new system also enables specifying custom decomposition rules. When :func:`~pennylane.decomposition.enable_graph`
is present, the :func:`~pennylane.transforms.decompose` transform accepts two additional keyword
arguments: ``fixed_decomps`` and ``alt_decomps``. The user can define custom decomposition rules
as explained in the :ref:`Defining Decomposition Rules <decomps_rules>` section, and provide them
to the transform via these arguments.

``fixed_decomps`` forces the transform to use the specified decomposition rules for
certain operators, whereas ``alt_decomps`` is used to provide alternative decomposition rules
for operators that may be chosen if they lead to a more resource-efficient decomposition.

In the following example, ``isingxx_decomp`` will always be used to decompose ``qml.IsingXX``
gates; when it comes to ``qml.CNOT``, the system will choose the most efficient decomposition rule
among ``my_cnot1``, ``my_cnot2``, and all existing decomposition rules defined for ``qml.CNOT``.

.. code-block:: python

    from functools import partial
    import pennylane as qml

    qml.decomposition.enable_graph()

    @qml.register_resources({qml.CNOT: 2, qml.RX: 1})
    def isingxx_decomp(phi, wires, **__):
        qml.CNOT(wires=wires)
        qml.RX(phi, wires=[wires[0]])
        qml.CNOT(wires=wires)

    @qml.register_resources({qml.H: 2, qml.CZ: 1})
    def my_cnot1(wires, **__):
        qml.H(wires=wires[1])
        qml.CZ(wires=wires)
        qml.H(wires=wires[1])

    @qml.register_resources({qml.RY: 2, qml.CZ: 1, qml.Z: 2})
    def my_cnot2(wires, **__):
        qml.RY(np.pi/2, wires[1])
        qml.Z(wires[1])
        qml.CZ(wires=wires)
        qml.RY(np.pi/2, wires[1])
        qml.Z(wires[1])

    @partial(
        qml.transforms.decompose,
        gate_set={"RX", "RZ", "CZ", "GlobalPhase"},
        alt_decomps={qml.CNOT: [my_cnot1, my_cnot2]},
        fixed_decomps={qml.IsingXX: isingxx_decomp},
    )
    @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
    def circuit():
        qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
        qml.IsingXX(0.5, wires=[0, 1])
        return qml.state()


.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> qml.specs(circuit)()["resources"].gate_types
    defaultdict(int, {'RZ': 12, 'RX': 7, 'GlobalPhase': 6, 'CZ': 3})

To register alternative decomposition rules under an operator to be used globally, use
:func:`~pennylane.add_decomps`. See :ref:`Inspecting and Managing Decomposition Rules <decomps_management>`
for details.

Graph-based Decomposition Solver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~DecompositionGraph

The decomposition graph is a directed graph of operators and decomposition rules. Dijkstra's
algorithm is used to explore the graph and find the most efficient decomposition of a given
operator towards a target gate set.

.. code-block:: python

    op = qml.CRX(0.5, wires=[0, 1])
    graph = DecompositionGraph(
        operations=[op],
        gate_set={"RZ", "RX", "CNOT", "GlobalPhase"},
    )
    graph.solve()

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
    ...     graph.decomposition(op)(0.5, wires=[0, 1])
    >>> q.queue
    [RZ(1.5707963267948966, wires=[1]),
     RY(0.25, wires=[1]),
     CNOT(wires=[0, 1]),
     RY(-0.25, wires=[1]),
     CNOT(wires=[0, 1]),
     RZ(-1.5707963267948966, wires=[1])]
    >>> graph.resource_estimate(op)
    <num_gates=10, gate_counts={RZ: 6, CNOT: 2, RX: 2}>
