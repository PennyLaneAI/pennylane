"""Implements the class DecompositionGraph

This module implements a graph-based decomposition algorithm that constructs a graph of operators
connected by decomposition rules, and then traverses it using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the best
decomposition for every operator.

The architecture of this module utilizes design patterns similar to those present in Qiskit's
implementation of the basis translator, the Boost Graph library, and RustworkX.

class DecompositionGraph:  # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes,too-few-public-methods
    """A graph that models a decomposition problem.

    The decomposition graph contains two types of nodes: operator nodes and decomposition nodes.
    Each decomposition node is a :class:`pennylane.decomposition.DecompositionRule`, and each
    operator node is a :class:`~pennylane.decomposition.resources.CompressedResourceOp` which
    contains an operator type and any additional parameters that affect the resource requirements
    of the operator. Essentially, two instances of the same operator type are represented by the
    same node in the graph if they're expected to have the same decompositions.

    There are also two types of directed edges: edges that connect operators to the decomposition
    rules that contain them, and edges that connect decomposition rules to the operators that they
    decompose. The edge weights represent the difference in the total weights of the gates between
    the two states. Edges that connect decomposition rules to operators have a weight of 0 because
    an operator can be replaced with its decomposition at no additional cost.

    On the other hand, edges that connect operators to the decomposition rule that contains them
    will have a weight that is the total resource estimate of the decomposition minus the resource
    estimate of the operator. Edges that connect an operator node to a decomposition node have a weight
    calculated by the difference of the sum of the gate counts multiplied by their respective gate
    weights in the decomposition, minus the weight of the operator of the operator node.

    For example, if the graph was initialized with ``{qml.CNOT: 10.0, qml.H: 1.0}`` as the gate set,
    the edge that connects a ``CNOT`` to the following decomposition rule:

    .. code-block:: python

        import pennylane as qml

        @qml.register_resources({qml.H: 2, qml.CNOT: 1})
        def my_cz(wires):
            qml.H(wires=wires[1])
            qml.CNOT(wires=wires)
            qml.H(wires=wires[1])

    will have a weight of (10.0 + 2 * 1.0) - 10.0 = 2, because the decomposition rule contains 2 additional
    ``H`` gates. Note that this gate count is in terms of gates in the target gate set. If ``H`` isn't
    supported and is in turn decomposed to two ``RZ`` gates and one ``RX`` gate, the weight of this edge
    becomes 2 * 3 = 6, if ``RZ`` and ``RX`` have weights of 1.0 (the default). This way, the total distance
    from the basis gate set to a high-level gate is by default the total number of basis gates required to
    decompose this high-level gate, which allows us to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the most efficient
    decomposition. By specifying weights in the target gate set, the total distance calculation involves
    a sum of weighted gate counts, which can represent the relative cost of executing a particular element
    of the target gate set on the target hardware i.e. a ``T`` gate.

    Args:
        operations (list[Operator or CompressedResourceOp]): The list of operations to decompose.
        gate_set (set[str | type] | dict[type | str, float]): A set of gates in the target gate set or a dictionary
            mapping gates in the target gate set to their respective weights. All weights must be positive.
        fixed_decomps (dict): A dictionary mapping operator names to fixed decompositions.
        alt_decomps (dict): A dictionary mapping operator names to alternative decompositions.
