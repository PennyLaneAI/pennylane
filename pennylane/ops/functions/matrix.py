def matrix(op: qml.operation.Operator, wire_order=None) -> TensorLike:
    r"""The matrix representation of an operation or quantum circuit.

    Args:
        op (Operator or QNode or QuantumTape or Callable): A quantum operator or quantum circuit.
        wire_order (Sequence[Any], optional): Order of the wires in the quantum circuit.
            Defaults to the order in which the wires appear in the quantum function.

    Returns:
        TensorLike or qnode (QNode) or quantum function (Callable) or tuple[List[QuantumTape], function]:

        If an operator is provided as input, the matrix is returned directly in the form of a tensor.
        Otherwise, the transformed circuit is returned as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.
        Executing this circuit will provide its matrix representation.

    **Example**

    Given an instantiated operator, ``qml.matrix`` returns the matrix representation:

    >>> op = qml.RX(0.54, wires=0)
    >>> qml.matrix(op)
    [[0.9637709+0.j         0.       -0.26673144j]
    [0.       -0.26673144j 0.9637709+0.j        ]]

    It can also be used in a functional form:

    >>> x = torch.tensor(0.6, requires_grad=True)
    >>> matrix_fn = qml.matrix(qml.RX)
    >>> matrix_fn(x, wires=0)
    tensor([[0.9553+0.0000j, 0.0000-0.2955j],
            [0.0000-0.2955j, 0.9553+0.0000j]], grad_fn=<AddBackward0>)

    In its functional form, it is fully differentiable with respect to gate arguments:

    >>> loss = torch.real(torch.trace(matrix_fn(x, wires=0)))
    >>> loss.backward()
    >>> x.grad
    tensor(-0.5910)

    This operator transform can also be applied to QNodes, tapes, and quantum functions
    that contain multiple operations; see Usage Details below for more details.

    .. details::
        :title: Usage Details

        ``qml.matrix`` can also be used with QNodes, tapes, or quantum functions that
        contain multiple operations.

        Consider the following quantum function:

        .. code-block:: python3

            def circuit(theta):
                qml.RX(theta, wires=1)
                qml.PauliZ(wires=0)

        We can use ``qml.matrix`` to generate a new function that returns the unitary matrix
        corresponding to the function ``circuit``:

        >>> matrix_fn = qml.matrix(circuit)
        >>> theta = np.pi / 4
        >>> matrix_fn(theta)
        array([[ 0.92387953+0.j,  0.+0.j ,  0.-0.38268343j,  0.+0.j],
        [ 0.+0.j,  -0.92387953+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0. +0.38268343j],
        [ 0. -0.38268343j,  0.+0.j,  0.92387953+0.j,  0.+0.j],
        [ 0.+0.j,  0.+0.38268343j,  0.+0.j,  -0.92387953+0.j]])

        Note that since ``wire_order`` was not specified, the default order ``[1, 0]`` for ``circuit``
        was used, and the unitary matrix corresponds to the operation :math:`R_X(\theta)\otimes Z`. To
        obtain the matrix for :math:`Z\otimes R_X(\theta)`, specify ``wire_order=[0, 1]`` in the
        function call:

        >>> matrix = qml.matrix(circuit, wire_order=[0, 1])

        You can also get the unitary matrix for operations on a subspace of a larger Hilbert space. For
        example, with the same function ``circuit`` and ``wire_order=["a", 0, "b", 1]`` you obtain the
        :math:`16\times 16` matrix for the operation :math:`I\otimes Z\otimes I\otimes  R_X(\theta)`.

        This unitary matrix can also be used in differentiable calculations. For example, consider the
        following cost function:

        .. code-block:: python

            def circuit(theta):
                qml.RX(theta, wires=1) qml.PauliZ(wires=0)
                qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])

            def cost(theta):
                matrix = qml.matrix(circuit)(theta)
                return np.real(np.trace(matrix))

        Since this cost function returns a real scalar as a function of ``theta``, we can differentiate
        it:

        >>> theta = np.array(0.3, requires_grad=True)
        >>> cost(theta)
        1.9775421558720845
        >>> qml.grad(cost)(theta)
        -0.14943813247359922
