def dot(

    r"""Returns the dot product between the ``coeffs`` vector and the ``ops`` list of operators.

    This function returns the following linear combination: :math:`\sum_{k} c_k O_k`, where
    :math:`c_k` and :math:`O_k` are the elements inside the ``coeffs`` and ``ops`` arguments, respectively.

    Args:
        coeffs (Sequence[float, Callable]): sequence containing the coefficients of the linear combination
        ops (Sequence[Operator]): sequence containing the operators of the linear combination
        pauli (bool, optional): If ``True``, a :class:`~.PauliSentence`
            operator is used to represent the linear combination. If False, a :class:`Sum` operator
            is returned. Defaults to ``False``. Note that when ``ops`` consists solely of ``PauliWord``
            and ``PauliSentence`` instances, the function still returns a PennyLane operator when ``pauli=False``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the number of coefficients and operators does not match or if they are empty

    Returns:
        Operator or ParametrizedHamiltonian: operator describing the linear combination

    **Example**

    >>> coeffs = np.array([1.1, 2.2])
    >>> ops = [qml.X(0), qml.Y(0)]
    >>> qml.dot(coeffs, ops)
    1.1 * X(0) + 2.2 * Y(0)
    >>> qml.dot(coeffs, ops, pauli=True)
    1.1 * X(0)
    + 2.2 * Y(0)

    Note that additions of the same operator are not executed by default.

    >>> qml.dot([1., 1.], [qml.X(0), qml.X(0)])
    X(0) + X(0)

    You can obtain a cleaner version by simplifying the resulting expression.

    >>> qml.dot([1., 1.], [qml.X(0), qml.X(0)]).simplify()
    2.0 * X(0)

    ``pauli=True`` can be used to construct a more efficient, simplified version of the operator.
    Note that it returns a :class:`~.PauliSentence`, which is not an :class:`~.Operator`. This
    specialized representation can be converted to an operator:

    >>> qml.dot([1, 2], [qml.X(0), qml.X(0)], pauli=True).operation()
    3.0 * X(0)

    Using ``pauli=True`` and then converting the result to an :class:`~.Operator` is much faster
    than using ``pauli=False``, but it only works for pauli words
    (see :func:`~.is_pauli_word`).

    If any of the parameters listed in ``coeffs`` are callables, the resulting dot product will be a
    :class:`~.ParametrizedHamiltonian`:

    >>> coeffs = [lambda p, t: p * jnp.sin(t) for _ in range(2)]
    >>> ops = [qml.X(0), qml.Y(0)]
    >>> qml.dot(coeffs, ops)
    (
        <lambda>(params_0, t) * X(0)
      + <lambda>(params_1, t) * Y(0)
    )
