def dot(coeffs: Sequence[float], ops: Sequence[Operator], pauli=False):
    r"""Returns the dot product between the ``coeffs`` vector and the ``ops`` list of operators.

    This function returns the following linear combination: :math:`\sum_{k} c_k O_k`, where
    :math:`c_k` and :math:`O_k` are the elements inside the ``coeffs`` and ``ops`` arguments, respectively.

    Args:
        coeffs (Sequence[float]): sequence containing the coefficients of the linear combination
        ops (Sequence[Operator]): sequence containing the operators of the linear combination
        pauli (bool, optional): If ``True``, a :class:`~.PauliSentence`
            operator is used to represent the linear combination. If False, a :class:`Sum` operator
            is returned. Defaults to ``False``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the number of coefficients and operators does not match or if they are empty

    Returns:
        Sum or Operator: operator describing the linear combination

    **Example**

    >>> coeffs = np.array([1.1, 2.2])
    >>> ops = [qml.PauliX(0), qml.PauliY(0)]
    >>> qml.dot(coeffs, ops)
    (1.1*(PauliX(wires=[0]))) + (2.2*(PauliY(wires=[0])))
    >>> qml.dot(coeffs, ops, pauli=True)
    1.1 * X(0)
    + 2.2 * Y(0)

    ``pauli=True`` can be used to construct a more efficient, simplified version of the operator.
    Note that it returns a :class:`~.PauliSentence`, which is not an :class:`~.Operator`. This
    specialized representation can be converted to an operator:

    >>> qml.dot([1, 2], [qml.PauliX(0), qml.PauliX(0)], pauli=True).operation()
    3.0*(PauliX(wires=[0]))

    Using ``pauli=True`` and then converting the result to an :class:`~.Operator` is much faster
    than using ``pauli=False``, but it only works for pauli words
    (see :func:`~.is_pauli_word`).
