class SpecialUnitary(Operation):
    r"""Gate from the group :math:`SU(N)` with :math:`N=2^n` for :math:`n` qubits.

    We use the following parametrization of a special unitary operator:

    .. math::

        U(\theta) &= e^{A(\theta)}\\
        A(\theta) &= \sum_{m=1}^d i \theta_m P_m\\
        P_m &\in \{I, X, Y, Z\}^{\otimes n} \setminus \{I^{\otimes n}\}

    This means, :math:`U(\theta)` is the exponential of operator :math:`A(\theta)`,
    which in turn is a linear combination of Pauli words with coefficients :math:`i\theta`
    and satisfies :math:`A(\theta)^\dagger=-A(\theta)` (it is *skew-Hermitian*).
    Note that this gate takes an exponential number :math:`d=4^n-1` of parameters.

    **Details:**

    * Number of wires: Any
    * Number of parameters: 1
    * Number of dimensions per parameter: (1,)
    * Gradient recipe:

    .. math::

        \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_\ell} f(U(\theta)) = -i \sum_{m=1}^d \omega_{\ell m}
        \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x} f(e^{ixP_m} U(\theta))

    where :math:`f` is an expectation value depending on :math:`U(\theta)` and the derivative
    of the Pauli rotation gates :math:`e^{ixP_m}` can be computed with the two-term
    parameter-shift rule (also see: :class:`~.PauliRot`).

    Args:
        theta (tensor_like): Pauli coordinates of the exponent :math:`A(\theta)`.
            See details below for the order of the Pauli words.
        wires (Sequence[int] or int): The wire(s) the operation acts on
        do_queue (bool): Indicates whether the operator should be
            immediately pushed into the Operator queue (optional)
        id (str or None): String representing the operation (optional)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the shape of the input parameter does not match the Lie algebra
            dimension :math:`d=4^n-1` for :math:`n` wires.

    .. note::

        This operation should only be used to parametrize special unitaries that
        can not easily be represented by other operations, as it incurs
        computational cost that scale exponentially with the wires it acts on.

    The parameter ``theta`` refers to all Pauli words (except for the identity) in
    lexicographical order, which looks like the following for one and two qubits:

    >>> qml.ops.qubit.special_unitary.pauli_basis_strings(1) # 4**1-1 = 3 Pauli words
    ['X', 'Y', 'Z']
    >>> qml.ops.qubit.special_unitary.pauli_basis_strings(2) # 4**2-1 = 15 Pauli words
    ['IX', 'IY', 'IZ', 'XI', 'XX', 'XY', 'XZ', 'YI', 'YX', 'YY', 'YZ', 'ZI', 'ZX', 'ZY', 'ZZ']

    **Examples**

    Simple examples of this operation are single-qubit Pauli rotation gates, which can be
    created by setting all but one parameter :math:`\theta_m` to zero:

    >>> x = 0.412
    >>> theta = x * np.array([1, 0, 0]) # The first entry belongs to the Pauli word "X"
    >>> su = qml.SpecialUnitary(theta, wires=0)
    >>> prot = qml.PauliRot(-2 * x, "X", wires=0) # PauliRot introduces a prefactor -0.5
    >>> rx = qml.RX(-2 * x, 0) # RX introduces a prefactor -0.5
    >>> qml.math.allclose(su.matrix(), prot.matrix())
    True
    >>> qml.math.allclose(su.matrix(), rx.matrix())
    True

    However, ``SpecialUnitary`` gates go beyong such rotations: Multiple Pauli words
    can be activated simultaneously, giving access to more complex operations.
    For two qubits, this could look like this:

    >>> wires = [0, 1]
    # Activating the Pauli words ["IY", "IZ", "XX", "XY", "YY", "YZ", "ZY", "ZZ"]
    >>> theta = 0.3 * np.array([0, 1, 2, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1])
    >>> len(theta) == 4 ** len(wires) - 1 # theta contains one parameter per Pauli word
    True
