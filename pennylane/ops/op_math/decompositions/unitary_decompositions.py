def one_qubit_decomposition(U, wire, rotations="ZYZ", return_global_phase=False):
    r"""Decompose a one-qubit unitary :math:`U` in terms of elementary operations.

    Any one qubit unitary operation can be implemented up to a global phase by composing
    RX, RY, and RZ gates. Currently supported values for ``rotations`` are "rot", "ZYZ",
    "XYX", "XZX", and "ZXZ".

    Args:
        U (tensor): A :math:`2 \times 2` unitary matrix.
        wire (Union[Wires, Sequence[int] or int]): The wire on which to apply the operation.

        return_global_phase (bool): Whether to return the global phase as a ``qml.GlobalPhase(-alpha)``
            as the last element of the returned list of operations.

    Returns:
        list[Operation]: A list of gates which when applied in the order of appearance in the list
            is equivalent to the unitary :math:`U` up to a global phase. If ``return_global_phase=True``,
            the global phase is returned as the last element of the list.

def two_qubit_decomposition(U, wires):
    r"""Decompose a two-qubit unitary :math:`U` in terms of elementary operations.

    It is known that an arbitrary two-qubit operation can be implemented using a
    maximum of 3 CNOTs. This transform first determines the required number of
    CNOTs, then decomposes the operator into a circuit with a fixed form.  These
    decompositions are based a number of works by Shende, Markov, and Bullock
    `(1) <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308033>`__, `(2)
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308045v3>`__, `(3)
    <https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~imarkov/pubs/conf/spie04-2qubits.pdf>`__,
    though we note that many alternative decompositions are possible.

    For the 3-CNOT case, we recover the following circuit, which is Figure 2 in
    reference (1) above:

    .. figure:: ../../_static/two_qubit_decomposition_3_cnots.svg
        :align: center
        :width: 70%
        :target: javascript:void(0);

    where :math:`A, B, C, D` are :math:`SU(2)` operations, and the rotation angles are
    computed based on features of the input unitary :math:`U`.

    For the 2-CNOT case, the decomposition is

    .. figure:: ../../_static/two_qubit_decomposition_2_cnots.svg
        :align: center
        :width: 50%
        :target: javascript:void(0);

    For 1 CNOT, we have a CNOT surrounded by one :math:`SU(2)` per wire on each
    side.  The special case of no CNOTs simply returns a tensor product of two
    :math:`SU(2)` operations.

    This decomposition can be applied automatically to all two-qubit
    :class:`~.QubitUnitary` operations using the
    :func:`~pennylane.transforms.unitary_to_rot` transform.

    .. warning::

        This decomposition will not be differentiable in the ``unitary_to_rot``
        transform if the matrix being decomposed depends on parameters with
        respect to which we would like to take the gradient.  See the
        documentation of :func:`~pennylane.transforms.unitary_to_rot` for
        explicit examples of the differentiable and non-differentiable cases.

    Args:
        U (tensor): A :math:`4 \times 4` unitary matrix.
        wires (Union[Wires, Sequence[int] or int]): The wires on which to apply the operation.

    Returns:
        list[Operation]: A list of operations that represent the decomposition
        of the matrix U.

    **Example**

    Suppose we create a random element of :math:`U(4)`, and would like to decompose it
    into elementary gates in our circuit.

    >>> from scipy.stats import unitary_group
    >>> U = unitary_group.rvs(4)
