    The generalized product operation represents both the tensor product as
    well as matrix composition. This can be resolved naturally from the wires
    that the given operators act on.

    Args:
        *ops (Union[tuple[~.operation.Operator], Callable]): The operators we would like to multiply.
            Alternatively, a single qfunc that queues operators can be passed to this function.

    Keyword Args:
        id (str or None): id for the product operator. Default is None.
        lazy=True (bool): If ``lazy=False``, a simplification will be performed such that when any of the operators is already a product operator, its operands will be used instead.

    Returns:
        ~ops.op_math.Prod: the operator representing the product.

        This operator supports batched operands:

        >>> op.matrix().shape
        (3, 4, 4)

        But it doesn't support batching of operators:

        >>> op = qml.prod(np.array([qml.RX(0.5, 0), qml.RZ(0.3, 0)]), qml.PauliZ(0))
        AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'wires'

    .. note::
        When a Prod operator is applied in a circuit, its factors are applied in the reverse order.
        (i.e ``Prod(op1, op2)`` corresponds to :math:`\hat{op}_{1}\cdot\hat{op}_{2}` which indicates
        first applying :math:`\hat{op}_{2}` then :math:`\hat{op}_{1}` in the circuit). We can see this
        in the decomposition of the operator.

    >>> op = Prod(qml.PauliX(wires=0), qml.PauliZ(wires=1))

    [PauliZ(wires=[1]), PauliX(wires=[0])]

    .. details::
        :title: Usage Details

        The Prod operator represents both matrix composition and tensor products
        between operators.

        >>> prod_op = Prod(qml.RZ(1.23, wires=0), qml.PauliX(wires=0), qml.PauliZ(wires=1))

               [ 0.        +0.j        ,  0.        +0.j        ,
                 0.        +0.j        , -0.81677345+0.57695852j],
               [ 0.81677345+0.57695852j,  0.        +0.j        ,
                 0.        +0.j        ,  0.        +0.j        ],

                 0.        +0.j        ,  0.        +0.j        ]])

        The Prod operation can be used inside a `qnode` as an operation which,
        if parameterized, can be differentiated.

        .. code-block:: python

            dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit(theta):
                qml.prod(qml.PauliZ(0), qml.RX(theta, 1))
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(1))

        >>> par = np.array(1.23, requires_grad=True)
        >>> circuit(par)
        tensor(0.33423773, requires_grad=True)
        >>> qml.grad(circuit)(par)
        tensor(-0.9424888, requires_grad=True)

        The Prod operation can also be measured as an observable.
        If the circuit is parameterized, then we can also differentiate through the
        product observable.
