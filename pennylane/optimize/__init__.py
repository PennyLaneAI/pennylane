.. currentmodule:: pennylane.optimize

In PennyLane, an optimizer is a procedure that executes one weight
update step along (some function of) the negative gradient of the cost.
This update depends in general on:

* The function :math:`f(x)`, from which we calculate a gradient :math:`\nabla f(x)`.
  If :math:`x` is a vector, the gradient is also a vector whose entries are
  the partial derivatives of :math:`f` with respect to the elements of :math:`x`.
* the current weights :math:`x`
* the (initial) step size :math:`\eta`

The different optimizers can also depend on additional hyperparameters.

In the following, recursive definitions assume that :math:`x^{(0)}` is some
initial value in the optimization landscape, and all other step-dependent
values are initialized to zero at :math:`t=0`.
