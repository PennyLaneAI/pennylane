def probs(wires=None, op=None) -> "ProbabilityMP":
    r"""Probability of each computational basis state.

    This measurement function accepts either a wire specification or
    an observable. Passing wires to the function
    instructs the QNode to return a flat array containing the
    probabilities :math:`|\langle i | \psi \rangle |^2` of measuring
    the computational basis state :math:`| i \rangle` given the current
    state :math:`| \psi \rangle`.

    Marginal probabilities may also be requested by restricting
    the wires to a subset of the full system; the size of the
    returned array will be ``[2**len(wires)]``.

    .. Note::
        If no wires or observable are given, the probability of all wires is returned.

    Args:
        wires (Sequence[int] or int): the wire the operation acts on
        op (Observable or MeasurementValue]): Observable (with a ``diagonalizing_gates``
            attribute) that rotates the computational basis, or a  ``MeasurementValue``
            corresponding to mid-circuit measurements.

    Returns:
        ProbabilityMP: Measurement process instance

    **Example:**

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit():
            qml.Hadamard(wires=1)
            return qml.probs(wires=[0, 1])

    Executing this QNode:

    >>> circuit()
    array([0.5, 0.5, 0. , 0. ])

    The returned array is in lexicographic order, so corresponds
    to a :math:`50\%` chance of measuring either :math:`|00\rangle`
    or :math:`|01\rangle`.

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

        H = 1 / np.sqrt(2) * np.array([[1, 1], [1, -1]])

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit():
            qml.PauliZ(wires=0)
            qml.PauliX(wires=1)
            return qml.probs(op=qml.Hermitian(H, wires=0))

    >>> circuit()
    array([0.14644661 0.85355339])

    The returned array is in lexicographic order, so corresponds
    to a :math:`14.6\%` chance of measuring the rotated :math:`|0\rangle` state
    and :math:`85.4\%` of measuring the rotated :math:`|1\rangle` state.

    Note that the output shape of this measurement process depends on whether
    the device simulates qubit or continuous variable quantum systems.
