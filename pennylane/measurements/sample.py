def sample(op: Union[Observable, None] = None, wires=None):
    r"""Sample from the supplied observable, with the number of shots
    determined from the ``dev.shots`` attribute of the corresponding device,
    returning raw samples. If no observable is provided then basis state samples are returned
    directly from the device.

    Note that the output shape of this measurement process depends on the shots
    specified on the device.

    Args:
        op (Observable or None): a quantum observable object
        wires (Sequence[int] or int or None): the wires we wish to sample from, ONLY set wires if
            op is ``None``

    Raises:
        QuantumFunctionError: `op` is not an instance of :class:`~.Observable`
        ValueError: Cannot set wires if an observable is provided

    The samples are drawn from the eigenvalues :math:`\{\lambda_i\}` of the observable.
    The probability of drawing eigenvalue :math:`\lambda_i` is given by
    :math:`p(\lambda_i) = |\langle \xi_i | \psi \rangle|^2`, where :math:`| \xi_i \rangle`
    is the corresponding basis state from the observable's eigenbasis.

    **Example**

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2, shots=4)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x):
            qml.RX(x, wires=0)
            qml.Hadamard(wires=1)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            return qml.sample(qml.PauliY(0))

    Executing this QNode:

    >>> circuit(0.5)
    array([ 1.,  1.,  1., -1.])

    If no observable is provided, then the raw basis state samples obtained
    from device are returned (e.g., for a qubit device, samples from the
    computational device are returned). In this case, ``wires`` can be specified
    so that sample results only include measurement results of the qubits of interest.

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2, shots=4)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x):
            qml.RX(x, wires=0)
            qml.Hadamard(wires=1)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            return qml.sample()

    Executing this QNode:

    >>> circuit(0.5)
    array([[0, 1],
           [0, 0],
           [1, 1],
           [0, 0]])

    .. note::

        QNodes that return samples cannot, in general, be differentiated, since the derivative
        with respect to a sample --- a stochastic process --- is ill-defined. The one exception
        is if the QNode uses the parameter-shift method (``diff_method="parameter-shift"``), in
        which case ``qml.sample(obs)`` is interpreted as a single-shot expectation value of the
        observable ``obs``.
