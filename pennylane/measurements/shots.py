class Shots:
    """
    A data class that stores shot information.

    Args:
        shots (Union[None, int, Sequence[int, Tuple[int, int]]]): Raw shot information

    Defining shots enables users to specify circuit executions, and the Shots class standardizes
    the internal representation of shots. There are three ways to specify shot values:

    * The value ``None``
    * A positive integer
    * A sequence consisting of either positive integers or a tuple-pair of positive integers of the form ``(shots, copies)``

    The tuple-pair of the form ``(shots, copies)`` is represented internally by a NamedTuple called
    :class:`~ShotCopies`. The first value is the number of shots to execute, and the second value is the
    number of times to repeat a circuit with that number of shots.

    The ``Shots`` class exposes two properties:

    * ``total_shots``, the total number of shots to be executed
    * ``shot_vector``, the tuple of :class:`~ShotCopies` to be executed

    Instances of this class are static. If an instance is passed to the constructor, that same
    instance is returned. If an instance is constructed with a ``None`` value, ``total_shots``
    will be ``None``.  This indicates analytic execution. A ``Shots`` object created with a
    ``None`` value is Falsy, while any other value results in a Truthy object:

    >>> bool(Shots(None)), bool(Shots(1))
    (False, True)

    **Examples**

    Example constructing a Shots instance with ``None``:

    >>> shots = Shots(None)
    >>> shots.total_shots, shots.shot_vector
    (None, ())

    Example constructing a Shots instance with an int:

    >>> shots = Shots(100)
    >>> shots.total_shots, shots.shot_vector
    (100, (ShotCopies(100 shots),))

    Example constructing a Shots instance with another instance:

    >>> shots = Shots(100)
    >>> Shots(shots) is shots
    True

    Example constructing a Shots instance with a sequence of ints:

    >>> shots = Shots([100, 200])
    >>> shots.total_shots, shots.shot_vector
    (300, (ShotCopies(100 shots x 1), ShotCopies(200 shots x 1)))

    Example constructing a Shots instance with a sequence of tuple-pairs:

    >>> shots = Shots(((100, 3), (200, 4),))
    >>> shots.total_shots, shots.shot_vector
    (1100, (ShotCopies(100 shots x 3), ShotCopies(200 shots x 4)))

    Example constructing a Shots instance with a sequence of both ints and tuple-pairs.
    Note that the first stand-alone ``100`` gets absorbed into the subsequent tuple because the
    shot value matches:

    >>> shots = Shots((10, 100, (100, 3), (200, 4),))
    >>> shots.total_shots, shots.shot_vector
    (1210, (ShotCopies(10 shots x 1), ShotCopies(100 shots x 4), ShotCopies(200 shots x 4)))

    One should also note that specifying a single tuple of length 2 is considered two different
    shot values, and *not* a tuple-pair representing shots and copies to avoid special behaviour
    depending on the iterable type:

    >>> shots = Shots((100, 2))
    >>> shots.total_shots, shots.shot_vector
    (102, (ShotCopies(100 shots x 1), ShotCopies(2 shots x 1)))

    >>> shots = Shots(((100, 2),))
    >>> shots.total_shots, shots.shot_vector
    (200, (ShotCopies(100 shots x 2),))
