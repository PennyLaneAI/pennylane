Traits for xDSL operations.

additional semantic information, or to group operations that have similar properties.

    The following is the definition of the `Elementwise` trait from MLIR:

    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/f8cb7987c64dcffb72414a40560055cb717dbf74/mlir/include/mlir/IR/OpDefinition.h#L1378-L1409

    TODO: Add this trait to all the elementwise operations in xdsl when upstreaming.

    Tags elementwise operations on vectors or tensors.

    NOTE: Not all ops that are "elementwise" in some abstract sense satisfy this trait.
    In particular, broadcasting behavior is not allowed.

    An `Elementwise` op must satisfy the following properties:

    1. If any result is a vector/tensor then at least one operand must also be a
       vector/tensor.
    2. If any operand is a vector/tensor then there must be at least one result
       and all results must be vectors/tensors.
    3. All operand and result vector/tensor types must be of the same shape. The
       shape may be dynamic in which case the op's behaviour is undefined for
       non-matching shapes.
    4. The operation must be elementwise on its vector/tensor operands and
       results. When applied to single-element vectors/tensors, the result must
       be the same per element.

    Rationale:
    - 1. and 2. guarantee a well-defined iteration space and exclude the cases
      of 0 non-scalar operands or 0 non-scalar results, which complicate a
      generic definition of the iteration space.
    - 3. guarantees that folding can be done across scalars/vectors/tensors with
      the same pattern, as otherwise lots of special handling for type
      mismatches would be needed.
    - 4. guarantees that no error handling is needed. Higher-level dialects
      should reify any needed guards or error handling code before lowering to
      an Elementwise op.
