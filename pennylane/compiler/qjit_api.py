    """A decorator for just-in-time compilation of hybrid quantum programs in PennyLane.

    This decorator enables both just-in-time and ahead-of-time compilation,
    depending on the compiler package and whether function argument type hints
    are provided.

    .. note::

        Currently, only the :doc:`Catalyst <catalyst:index>` hybrid quantum-classical
        compiler is supported. The Catalyst compiler works with the JAX interface

        For more details, see the Catalyst documentation and :func:`catalyst.qjit`
        docstring.

    .. note::

        Catalyst supports compiling QNodes that use ``lightning.qubit``,
        ``lightning.kokkos``, ``braket.local.qubit``, and ``braket.aws.qubit``
        devices. It does not support ``default.qubit``.

        Please see the :doc:`Catalyst documentation <catalyst:index>` for more details on
        supported devices, operations, and measurements.

    Args:
        fn (Callable): Hybrid (quantum-classical) function to compile
        compiler (str): Name of the compiler to use for just-in-time compilation
        autograph (bool): Experimental support for automatically converting Python control
            flow statements to Catalyst-compatible control flow. Currently supports Python ``if``,
            ``elif``, ``else``, and ``for`` statements. Note that this feature requires an
            available TensorFlow installation. See the
            :doc:`AutoGraph guide <catalyst:dev/autograph>` for more information.
        keep_intermediate (bool): Whether or not to store the intermediate files throughout the
            compilation. The files are stored at the location where the Python script is called.
            If ``True``, intermediate representations are available via the
            :attr:`~.QJIT.mlir`, :attr:`~.QJIT.jaxpr`, and :attr:`~.QJIT.qir`, representing
            different stages in the optimization process.
        verbosity (bool): If ``True``, the tools and flags used by Catalyst behind the scenes are
            printed out.
        logfile (TextIOWrapper): File object to write verbose messages to (default is
            ``sys.stderr``)
        pipelines (List[Tuple[str, List[str]]]): A list of pipelines to be executed. The
            elements of this list are named sequences of MLIR passes to be executed. A ``None``
            value (the default) results in the execution of the default pipeline. This option is
            considered to be used by advanced users for low-level debugging purposes.

    Returns:
        catalyst.QJIT: A class that, when executed, just-in-time compiles and executes the
        decorated function

    Raises:
        FileExistsError: Unable to create temporary directory
        PermissionError: Problems creating temporary directory
        OSError: Problems while creating folder for intermediate files
        AutoGraphError: Raised if there was an issue converting the given the function(s).
        ImportError: Raised if AutoGraph is turned on and TensorFlow could not be found.

    **Example**

    In just-in-time (JIT) mode, the compilation is triggered at the call site the
    first time the quantum function is executed. For example, ``circuit`` is
    compiled as early as the first call.

    .. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

        @qml.qjit
        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(theta):
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.RX(theta, wires=1)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0,1])
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=1))

    >>> circuit(0.5)  # the first call, compilation occurs here
    array(0.)
    >>> circuit(0.5)  # the precompiled quantum function is called
    array(0.)

    For more details on using the :func:`~.qjit` decorator and Catalyst
    with PennyLane, please refer to the Catalyst
    :doc:`quickstart guide <catalyst:dev/quick_start>`,
    as well as the :doc:`sharp bits and debugging tips <catalyst:dev/sharp_bits>`
    page for an overview of the differences between Catalyst and PennyLane, and
    how to best structure your workflows to improve performance when
    using Catalyst.
