    """A just-in-time decorator for PennyLane and JAX programs.

    .. note::

        This is a wrapper around
        `catalyst.while_loop <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/latest/code/api/catalyst.qjit.html>`__.


    This decorator enables both just-in-time and ahead-of-time compilation,
    depending on the compiler package and whether function argument type hints
    are provided.

    Args:
        compiler_name(str): name of the compiler package (Default is ``catalyst``)
        fn (Callable): the quantum or classical function
        autograph (bool): Experimental support for automatically converting Python control
            flow statements to Catalyst-compatible control flow. Currently supports Python ``if``,
            ``elif``, ``else``, and ``for`` statements. Note that this feature requires an
            available TensorFlow installation. Please see the
            `AutoGraph guide <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/latest/dev/autograph.html>`__
            for more information.
        target (str): the compilation target
        keep_intermediate (bool): Whether or not to store the intermediate files throughout the
            compilation. If ``True``, intermediate representations are available via the
            :attr:`~.QJIT.mlir`, :attr:`~.QJIT.jaxpr`, and :attr:`~.QJIT.qir`, representing
            different stages in the optimization process.
        verbosity (bool): If ``True``, the tools and flags used by Catalyst behind the scenes are
            printed out.
        logfile (Optional[TextIOWrapper]): File object to write verbose messages to (default -
            ``sys.stderr``).
        pipelines (Optional(List[Tuple[str,List[str]]])): A list of pipelines to be executed. The
            elements of this list are named sequences of MLIR passes to be executed. A ``None``
            value (the default) results in the execution of the default pipeline. This option is
            considered to be used by advanced users for low-level debugging purposes.

    Returns:
        QJIT object.

    Raises:
        FileExistsError: Unable to create temporary directory
        PermissionError: Problems creating temporary directory
        OSError: Problems while creating folder for intermediate files
        AutoGraphError: Raised if there was an issue converting the given the function(s).
        ImportError: Raised if AutoGraph is turned on and TensorFlow could not be found.

    **Example**

    In just-in-time (JIT) mode, the compilation is triggered at the call site the
    first time the quantum function is executed. For example, ``circuit`` is
    compiled as early as the first call.

    .. code-block:: python

        @qml.qjit
        @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2))
        def circuit(theta):
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.RX(theta, wires=1)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0,1])
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=1))

    >>> circuit(0.5)  # the first call, compilation occurs here
    array(0.)
    >>> circuit(0.5)  # the precompiled quantum function is called
    array(0.)

    Alternatively, if argument type hints are provided, compilation
    can occur 'ahead of time' when the function is decorated.

    .. code-block:: python

        from jax.core import ShapedArray

        @qml.qjit  # compilation happens at definition
        @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2))
        def circuit(x: complex, z: ShapedArray(shape=(3,), dtype=jnp.float64)):
            theta = jnp.abs(x)
            qml.RY(theta, wires=0)
            qml.Rot(z[0], z[1], z[2], wires=0)
            return qml.state()

    >>> circuit(0.2j, jnp.array([0.3, 0.6, 0.9]))  # calls precompiled function
    array([0.75634905-0.52801002j, 0. +0.j,
        0.35962678+0.14074839j, 0. +0.j])

    Catalyst also supports capturing imperative Python control flow in compiled programs. You can
    enable this feature via the ``autograph=True`` parameter. Note that it does come with some
    restrictions, in particular whenever global state is involved. Refer to the documentation page
    for a complete discussion of the supported and unsupported use-cases.

    .. code-block:: python

        @qml.qjit(autograph=True)
        @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2))
        def circuit(x: int):

            if x < 5:
                qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            else:
                qml.T(wires=0)

    This decorator provides a functional version of the traditional while
    loop, similar to ``jax.lax.while_loop``. That is, any variables that are
    modified across iterations need to be provided as inputs and outputs to
    the loop body function:

    - Input arguments contain the value of a variable at the start of an
      iteration

    - Output arguments contain the value at the end of the iteration. The
      outputs are then fed back as inputs to the next iteration.

    The final iteration values are also returned from the
    transformed function.

    This form of control flow can also be called from the Python interpreter without needing to use
    :func:`~.qjit`.

    The semantics of ``while_loop`` are given by the following Python pseudo-code:

    .. code-block:: python

        def while_loop(cond_fun, body_fun, *args):
            while cond_fun(*args):
                args = body_fn(*args)
            return args

    Args:
        cond_fn (Callable): the condition function in the while loop
        compiler_name (str): name of the compiler package (Default is ``catalyst``)

    Returns:
        Callable: A wrapper around the while-loop function.

    Raises:
        TypeError: Invalid return type of the condition expression.

    **Example**

    .. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

def for_loop(*args, compiler_name="catalyst", **kwargs):
    """A :func:`~.qjit` compatible for-loop decorator for PennyLane/Catalyst.

    .. note::

        This is a wrapper around
        `catalyst.for_loop <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/latest/code/api/catalyst.for_loop.html>`__.

    This for-loop representation is a functional version of the traditional
    for-loop, similar to ``jax.cond.fori_loop``. That is, any variables that
    are modified across iterations need to be provided as inputs/outputs to
    the loop body function:

    - Input arguments contain the value of a variable at the start of an
      iteration.

    - output arguments contain the value at the end of the iteration. The
      outputs are then fed back as inputs to the next iteration.

    The final iteration values are also returned from the transformed
    function.

    This form of control flow can also be called from the Python interpreter without needing to use
    :func:`~.qjit`.

    The semantics of ``for_loop`` are given by the following Python pseudo-code:

    .. code-block:: python

        def for_loop(lower_bound, upper_bound, step, loop_fn, *args):
            for i in range(lower_bound, upper_bound, step):
                args = loop_fn(i, *args)
            return args

    Unlike ``jax.cond.fori_loop``, the step can be negative if it is known at tracing time
    (i.e. constant). If a non-constant negative step is used, the loop will produce no iterations.

    Args:
        lower_bound (int): starting value of the iteration index
        upper_bound (int): (exclusive) upper bound of the iteration index
        step (int): increment applied to the iteration index at the end of each iteration
        compiler_name (str): name of the compiler package (Default is ``catalyst``)

    Returns:
        Callable[[int, ...], ...]: A wrapper around the loop body function.
        Note that the loop body function must always have the iteration index as its first argument,
        which can be used arbitrarily inside the loop body. As the value of the index across
        iterations is handled automatically by the provided loop bounds, it must not be returned
        from the function.

    **Example**


    .. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)
