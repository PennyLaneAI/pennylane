    In the JIT compilation of PennyLane programs, this helper method checks
    the status of the compilation. For example, Catalyst captures Python
    programs by tracing and we can tell if the caller is inside the Catalyst
    tracer context manager or not but calling this method.

    This method is practically useful in implementing quantum operations to
    correctly call the interpreter or compiler equivalent functions.
