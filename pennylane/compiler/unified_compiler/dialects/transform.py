This file contains an updated version of the transform dialect.
As of the time of writing, xDSL uses the MLIR released with LLVM's
version 20.1.7. However, https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/pull/1916
will be updating MLIR where the transform dialect has the
`apply_registered_pass` operation re-defined.

See the following changelog on the above PR

    Things related to transform.apply_registered_pass op:

    It now takes in a dynamic_options

    [MLIR][Transform] Allow ApplyRegisteredPassOp to take options as
    a param llvm/llvm-project#142683. We don't need to use this as all our pass options are static.
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/142683

    The options it takes in are now dictionaries instead of strings
    [MLIR][Transform] apply_registered_pass op's options as a dict llvm/llvm-project#143159
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/143159

This file will re-define the apply_registered_pass operation in xDSL
and the transform dialect.

Once xDSL moves to a newer version of MLIR, these changes should
be contributed upstream.
