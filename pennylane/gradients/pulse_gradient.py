    r"""Compute the gradient of a quantum circuit composed of pulse sequences by applying the
    stochastic parameter shift rule.

    For a pulse-based cost function :math:`C(\boldsymbol{v}, T)`
    with variational parameters :math:`\boldsymbol{v}` and evolution time :math:`T`, it is given by
    (c.f. Eqn. (6) in `Leng et al. (2022) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15812>`__ with altered
    notation):

    .. math::

        \frac{\partial C}{\partial v_k}
        = \int_{0}^{T} \mathrm{d}\tau \sum_{j=1}^m
        \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial v_k}(\boldsymbol{v}, \tau)
        \left[C_j^{(+)}(\boldsymbol{v}, \tau) - C_j^{(-)}(\boldsymbol{v}, \tau)\right]

    Here, :math:`f_j` are the pulse envelopes that capture the time dependence of the pulse
    Hamiltonian:

    .. math::

        H(\boldsymbol{v}, t) = H_\text{drift} + \sum_j f_j(\boldsymbol{v}, t) H_j,

    and :math:`C_j^{(\pm)}` are modified cost functions:

    .. math::
            C_j^{(\pm)}(\boldsymbol{v}, \tau)&=
            \bra{\psi^{(\pm)}_{j}(\boldsymbol{v}, \tau)} B
            \ket{\psi^{(\pm)}_{j}(\boldsymbol{v}, \tau)} \\
            \ket{\psi^{(\pm)}_{j}(\boldsymbol{v}, \tau)}
            &= U_{\boldsymbol{v}}(T, \tau) e^{-i \pm \frac{\pi}{2} H_j}
            U_{\boldsymbol{v}}(\tau, 0)\ket{\psi_0}.

    That is, the :math:`j`\ th modified time evolution in these circuit interrupts the
    evolution generated by the pulse Hamiltonian by inserting a rotation gate generated by
    the corresponding Hamiltonian term :math:`H_j` with a rotation angle of
    :math:`\pm\frac{\pi}{2}`.

    See below for a more detailed description. The integral in the first equation above
    is estimated numerically in the stochastic parameter-shift rule. For this, it samples
    split times :math:`\tau` and averages the modified cost functions and the Jacobians
    of the envelopes :math:`\partial f_j / \partial v_k` at the sampled times suitably.

    Args:
        tape (pennylane.QNode or .QuantumTape): quantum tape or QNode to differentiate
        argnum (int or list[int] or None): Trainable tape parameter indices to differentiate
            with respect to. If not provided, the derivatives with respect to all
            trainable parameters are returned.
        num_split_times (int): number of time samples to use in the stochastic parameter-shift
            rule underlying the differentiation; also see details
        sample_seed (int): randomness seed to be used for the time samples in the stochastic
            parameter-shift rule
        shots (None, int, list[int]): The shots of the device used to execute the tapes which are
            returned by this transform. Note that this argument does not *influence* the shots
            used for execution, but informs the transform about the shots to ensure a compatible
            return value structure.
        use_broadcasting (bool): Whether to use broadcasting across the different sampled
            splitting times. If ``False`` (the default), one set of modified tapes per
            splitting time is created, if ``True`` only a single set of broadcasted, modified
            tapes is created, increasing performance on simulators.

    Returns:
        function or tuple[list[QuantumTape], function]:

        - If the input is a QNode, an object representing the Jacobian (function) of the QNode
          that can be executed to obtain the Jacobian.
          The type of the Jacobian returned is either a tensor, a tuple or a
          nested tuple depending on the nesting structure of the original QNode output.

        - If the input is a tape, a tuple containing a
          list of generated tapes, together with a post-processing
          function to be applied to the results of the evaluated tapes
          in order to obtain the Jacobian.

    This transform realizes the stochastic parameter-shift rule for pulse sequences, as introduced
    in `Banchi and Crooks (2018) <https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-01-25-386/>`_ and
    `Leng et al. (2022) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15812>`_.

    .. note::

        This function requires the JAX interface and does not work with other autodiff interfaces
        commonly encountered with PennyLane.
        Finally, this transform is not JIT-compatible yet.

    .. note::

        This function uses a basic sampling approach with a uniform distribution to estimate the
        integral appearing in the stochastic parameter-shift rule. In many cases, there are
        probability distributions that lead to smaller variances of the estimator.
        In addition, the sampling approach will not reduce trivially to simpler parameter-shift
        rules when used with simple pulses (see details and examples below), potentially leading
        to imprecise results and/or unnecessarily large computational efforts.

    .. note::

        Currently this function only supports pulses for which each *parametrized* term is a
        simple Pauli word. More general Hamiltonian terms are not supported yet.

    **Examples**

    Consider a pulse program with a single two-qubit pulse, generated by a Hamiltonian
    with three terms: the non-trainable term :math:`\frac{1}{2}X\otimes I`, the trainable
    constant (over time) term :math:`v_1 Z\otimes Z` and the trainable sinoidal term
    :math:`\sin(v_2 t) (\frac{1}{5} Y\otimes I + \frac{7}{10} I\otimes X)`.

    .. code-block:: python

        from pennylane.gradients import stoch_pulse_grad

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit.jax", wires=2)

        def sin(p, t):
            return jax.numpy.sin(p * t)

        ZZ = qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1)
        Y_plus_X = qml.dot([1/5, 3/5], [qml.PauliY(0), qml.PauliX(1)])
        H = 0.5 * qml.PauliX(0) + qml.pulse.constant * ZZ + sin * Y_plus_X

        def ansatz(params):
            qml.evolve(H)(params, (0.2, 0.4))
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliY(1))

        qnode = qml.QNode(ansatz, dev, interface="jax", diff_method=qml.gradients.stoch_pulse_grad)

    The program takes the two parameters :math:`v_1, v_2` for the two trainable terms:

    >>> params = [jax.numpy.array(0.4), jax.numpy.array(1.3)]
    >>> qnode(params)
    Array(-0.0905377, dtype=float32)

    And as we registered the differentiation method :func:`~.stoch_pulse_grad`,
    we can compute its gradient in a hardware compatible manner:

    >>> jax.grad(qnode)(params)
    [Array(0.00054451, dtype=float32, weak_type=True),
     Array(-0.05673098, dtype=float32, weak_type=True)] # results may differ

    Note that the derivative is computed using a stochastic parameter-shift rule,
    which is based on a sampled approximation of an integral expression (see theoretical
    background below). This makes the computed derivative an approximate quantity subject
    to statistical fluctuations with notable variance. The number of samples used to
    approximate the integral can be chosen with ``num_split_times``, the seed for the
    sampling can be fixed with ``sampler_seed``:

    .. code-block:: python

        qnode = qml.QNode(
            ansatz,
            dev,
            interface="jax",
            diff_method=qml.gradients.stoch_pulse_grad,
            num_split_times=5, # Use 5 samples for the approximation
            sampler_seed=18, # Fix randomness seed
        )

    >>> jax.grad(qnode)(params)
    [Array(0.00210484, dtype=float32, weak_type=True),
     Array(-0.07159606, dtype=float32, weak_type=True)]

    On simulator devices, we may activate the option ``use_broadcasting``, which makes
    use of broadcasting internally to improve the performance of the stochastic parameter-shift
    rule:

    .. code-block:: python

        from time import process_time
        faster_grad_qnode = qml.QNode(
            ansatz,
            dev,
            interface="jax",
            diff_method=qml.gradients.stoch_pulse_grad,
            num_split_times=5, # Use 5 samples for the approximation
            sampler_seed=18, # Fix randomness seed
            use_broadcasting=True, # Activate broadcasting
        )
        times = []
        for node in [qnode, faster_grad_qnode]:
            start = process_time()
            jax.grad(node)(params)
            times.append(process_time() - start)

    >>> print(times) # Show the gradient computation times in seconds.
    [44.92675887899999, 10.405261402999997]

    .. warning::

        As the option ``use_broadcasting=True`` adds a broadcasting dimension to the modified
        circuits, it is not compatible with circuits that already are broadcasted.

    .. details::
        :title: Theoretical background
        :href: theory

        Consider a pulse generated by a time-dependent Hamiltonian

        .. math::

            H(\boldsymbol{v}, t) = H_\text{drift} + \sum_j f_j(v_j, t) H_j,

        where :math:`\boldsymbol{v}=\{v_j\}` are variational parameters and :math:`t` is the time.
        In addition, consider a cost function that is based on using this pulse for
        a duration :math:`T`
        in a pulse sequence and measuring the expectation value of an observable.
        For simplicity we absorb the parts of the sequence
        before and after the considered pulse into the initial state and the observable,
        respectively:

        .. math::

            C(\boldsymbol{v}, t) =
            \bra{\psi_0} U_{\boldsymbol{v}}(T, 0)^\dagger B U_{\boldsymbol{v}}(T, 0)\ket{\psi_0}.

        Here, we denoted the unitary evolution under :math:`H(\boldsymbol{v}, t)` from time
        :math:`t_1` to :math:`t_2` as :math:`U_{\boldsymbol{v}(t_2, t_1)}`.
        Then the derivative of :math:`C` with respect to a specific parameter :math:`v_k`
        is given by (see Eqn. (6) of `Leng et al. (2022) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15812>`_)

        .. math::

            \frac{\partial C}{\partial v_k}
            = \int_{0}^{T} \mathrm{d}\tau \sum_{j=1}^m
            \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial v_k}(\boldsymbol{v}, \tau)
            \widetilde{C_j}(\boldsymbol{v}, \tau).

        Here, the integral ranges over the duration of the pulse, the partial derivatives of
        the coefficient functions, :math:`\partial f_j / \partial v_k`, are computed classically,
        and :math:`\widetilde{C_j}` is a linear combination of the results from modified pulse
        sequence executions based on generalized parameter-shift rules
        (see e.g. `Kyriienko and Elfving (2022) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01218>`_ or
        `Wierichs et al. (2022) <https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2022-03-30-677>`_ for more details
        and :func:`~.param_shift` for an implementation of the non-stochastic generalized shift
        rules)
        Given the parameter shift rule with coefficients :math:`\{y_\ell\}` and shifts
        :math:`\{x_\ell\}` for the single-parameter pulse :math:`\exp(-i \theta H_j)`,
        the linear combination is given by

        .. math::

            \widetilde{C_j}(\boldsymbol{v}, \tau)&=\sum_{\ell=1} y_\ell
            \bra{\psi_{j}(\boldsymbol{v}, x_\ell, \tau)} B
            \ket{\psi_{j}(\boldsymbol{v}, x_\ell, \tau)} \\
            \ket{\psi_{j}(\boldsymbol{v}, x_\ell, \tau)}
            &= U_{\boldsymbol{v}}(T, \tau) e^{-i x_\ell H_j}
            U_{\boldsymbol{v}}(\tau, 0)\ket{\psi_0}.

        In practice, the time integral over :math:`\tau` is computed by sampling values for
        the time, evaluating the integrand, and averaging appropriately. The probability
        distribution used for the sampling may have a significant impact on the quality of the
        obtained estimates, in particular with regards to their variance.
        In this function, a uniform distribution over the interval :math:`[0, t]` is used,
        which often can be improved upon.

        **Examples**

        Consider the pulse generated by

        .. math::

            H(\boldsymbol{v}, t) = \frac{1}{2} X\otimes I + v_1 Z\otimes Z + \sin(v_2 t) I\otimes X

        and the observable :math:`B=I\otimes Y`. There are two variational parameters, :math:`v_1`
        and :math:`v_2`, for which we may compute the derivative of the cost function:

        .. math::

            \frac{\partial C}{\partial v_1}
            &= \int_{0}^{T} \mathrm{d}\tau \ \widetilde{C_1}((v_1, v_2), \tau)\\
            \frac{\partial C}{\partial v_2}
            &= \int_{0}^{T} \mathrm{d}\tau \cos(v_2 \tau) \tau \ \widetilde{C_2}((v_1, v_2), \tau)\\
            \widetilde{C_j}((v_1, v_2), \tau)&=
            \bra{\psi_{j}((v_1, v_2), \pi/4, \tau)} B
            \ket{\psi_{j}((v_1, v_2), \pi/4, \tau)}\\
            &-\bra{\psi_{j}((v_1, v_2), -\pi/4, \tau)} B
            \ket{\psi_{j}((v_1, v_2), -\pi/4, \tau)} \\
            \ket{\psi_{j}((v_1, v_2), x, \tau)}
            &= U_{(v_1, v_2)}(T, \tau) e^{-i x H_j}U_{(v_1, v_2)}(\tau, 0)\ket{0}.

        Here we used the partial derivatives

        .. math::

            \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial v_1}&= 1\\
            \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial v_2}&= \cos(v_2 t) t \\
            \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial v_2}=
            \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial v_1}&= 0

        and the fact that both :math:`H_1=Z\otimes Z` and :math:`H_2=I\otimes X`
        have two unique eigenvalues and therefore admit a two-term parameter-shift rule
        (see e.g. `Schuld et al. (2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11184>`_).

        As a second scenario, consider the single-qubit pulse generated by

        .. math::

            H((v_1, v_2), t) = v_1 \sin(v_2 t) X

        together with the observable :math:`B=Z`.
        You may already notice that this pulse can be rewritten as a :class:`~.RX` rotation,
        because we have a single Hamiltonian term and the spectrum of :math:`H` consequently
        will be constant up to rescaling.
        In particular, the unitary time evolution under the Schrödinger equation is given by

        .. math::

            U_{(v_1, v_2)}(t_2, t_1) &=
            \exp\left(-i\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathrm{d}\tau v_1 \sin(v_2 \tau) X\right)\\
            &=\exp(-i\theta(v_1, v_2) X)\\
            \theta(v_1, v_2) &= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathrm{d}\tau v_1 \sin(v_2 \tau)\\
            &=-\frac{v_1}{v_2}(\cos(v_2 t_2) - \cos(v_2 t_1)).

        As the ``RX`` rotation satisfies a (non-stochastic) two-term parameter-shift rule,
        we could compute the derivatives with respect to :math:`v_1` and :math:`v_2` by
        implementing :math:`\exp(-i\theta(v_1, v_2) X)`, applying the two-term shift rule
        and evaluating the classical Jacobian of the mapping :math:`\theta(v_1, v_2)`.

        Using the stochastic parameter-shift rule instead will lead to approximation errors.
        This is because the approximated integral not only includes the shifted circuit
        evaluations, which do not depend on :math:`\tau` in this example, but also on the
        classical Jacobian, which is *not* constant over :math:`\tau`.
        Therefore, it is important to implement pulses in the simplest way possible.
