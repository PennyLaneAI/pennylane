    r"""Transform a QNode to compute the parameter-shift Hessian with respect to its trainable
    parameters.

    Use this transform to explicitly generate and explore parameter-shift circuits for computing
    the Hessian of QNodes directly, without computing first derivatives.

    For second-order derivatives of more complicated cost functions, please consider using your
    chosen autodifferentiation framework directly, by chaining gradient computations:

    >>> qml.jacobian(qml.grad(cost))(weights)

    Args:
        tape (pennylane.QNode or .QuantumTape): quantum tape or QNode to differentiate
        argnum (int or list[int] or array_like[bool] or None): Parameter indices to differentiate
            with respect to. If not provided, the Hessian with respect to all
            trainable indices is returned. Note that the indices refer to tape
            parameters both if ``tape`` is a tape, and if it is a QNode. If an ``array_like``
            is provided, it is expected to be a symmetric two-dimensional Boolean mask with
            shape ``(n, n)`` where ``n`` is the number of trainable tape parameters.
        diagonal_shifts (list[tuple[int or float]]): List containing tuples of shift values
            for the Hessian diagonal. The shifts are understood as first-order derivative
            shifts and are iterated to obtain the second-order derivative.
            If provided, one tuple of shifts should be given per trainable parameter
            and the tuple length should match the number of frequencies for that parameter.
            If unspecified, equidistant shifts are used.
        off_diagonal_shifts (list[tuple[int or float]]): List containing tuples of shift
            values for the off-diagonal entries of the Hessian.
            If provided, one tuple of shifts should be given per trainable parameter
            and the tuple should match the number of frequencies for that parameter.
            The combination of shifts into bivariate shifts is performed automatically.
            If unspecified, equidistant shifts are used.
        f0 (tensor_like[float] or None): Output of the evaluated input tape. If provided,
            and the Hessian tapes include the original input tape, the 'f0' value is used
            instead of evaluating the input tape, reducing the number of device invocations.

    Returns:
        tensor_like or tuple[tensor_like] or tuple[list[QuantumTape], function]:

        - If the input is a QNode with a single trainable argument, a tensor representing the
          Hessian of size ``(*QNode output dimensions, *QNode input dimensions, *QNode input dimensions)``
          is returned.

        - If the input is a QNode with multiple trainable arguments, a tuple of Hessian tensors is
          returned, one for each argument.

        - If the input is a tape, a tuple containing the list of parameter-shifted tapes, and a
          post-processing function to be applied to the evaluated tapes, is returned.

        Note: By default a QNode with the keyword ``hybrid=True`` computes derivates with respect to
        QNode arguments, which can include classical computations on those arguments before they are
        passed to quantum operations. The "purely quantum" Hessian can instead be obtained with
        ``hybrid=False``, which is then computed with respect to the gate arguments and produces a
        result of shape ``(*QNode output dimensions, # gate arguments, # gate arguments)``.

    **Example**

    Applying the Hessian transform to a QNode computes its Hessian tensor:

    >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)
    >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
    ... def circuit(x):
    ...     qml.RX(x[0], wires=0)
    ...     qml.CRY(x[1], wires=[0, 1])
    ...     return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0)@qml.PauliZ(1))

    >>> x = np.array([0.5, 0.2], requires_grad=True)
    >>> qml.gradients.param_shift_hessian(circuit)(x)
    tensor([[-0.86883595,  0.04762358],
            [ 0.04762358,  0.05998862]], requires_grad=True)

    .. details::
        :title: Usage Details

        The Hessian transform can also be applied to a quantum tape instead of a QNode, producing
        the parameter-shifted tapes and a post-processing function to combine the execution
        results of these tapes into the Hessian:

        >>> circuit(x)  # generate the QuantumTape inside the QNode
        >>> tape = circuit.qtape
        >>> hessian_tapes, postproc_fn = qml.gradients.param_shift_hessian(tape)
        >>> len(hessian_tapes)
        13
        >>> all(isinstance(tape, qml.tape.QuantumTape) for tape in hessian_tapes)
        True
        >>> postproc_fn(qml.execute(hessian_tapes, dev, None))
        array([[-0.86883595,  0.04762358],
               [ 0.04762358,  0.05998862]])

        The Hessian tapes can be inspected via their draw function, which reveals the different
        gate arguments generated from parameter-shift rules (we only draw the first four out of
        all 13 tapes here):

        >>> for h_tape in hessian_tapes[0:4]:
        ...     print(qml.drawer.tape_text(h_tape, decimals=1))
        0: ──RX(0.5)─╭●───────┤ ╭<Z@Z>

        To enable more detailed control over the parameter shifts, shift values can be provided
        per parameter, and separately for the diagonal and the off-diagonal terms.
        Here we choose them based on the parameters ``x`` themselves, mostly yielding multiples of
        the original parameters in the shifted tapes.

        >>> diag_shifts = [(x[0] / 2,), (x[1] / 2, x[1])]
        >>> offdiag_shifts = [(x[0],), (x[1], 2 * x[1])]
        >>> hessian_tapes, postproc_fn = qml.gradients.param_shift_hessian(
        ...     tape, diagonal_shifts=diag_shifts, off_diagonal_shifts=offdiag_shifts
        ... )
        >>> for h_tape in hessian_tapes[0:4]:
        ...     print(qml.drawer.tape_text(h_tape, decimals=1))

        .. note::

            Note that the ``diagonal_shifts`` are interpreted as *first-order* derivative
            shift values. That means they are used to generate a first-order derivative
            recipe, which then is iterated in order to obtain the second-order derivative
            for the diagonal Hessian entry. Explicit control over the used second-order
            shifts is not implemented.

        Finally, the ``argnum`` argument can be used to compute the Hessian only for some of the
        variational parameters. Note that this indexing refers to trainable tape parameters both
        if ``tape`` is a ``QNode`` and if it is a ``QuantumTape``.
