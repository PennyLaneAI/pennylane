@hessian_transform
def param_shift_hessian(tape, f0=None):
    r"""Transform a QNode to compute the parameter-shift Hessian with respect to its trainable
    parameters.

    Use this transform to explicitly generate and explore parameter-shift circuits for computing
    the Hessian of QNodes directly, without computing first derivatives.

    For second-order derivatives of more complicated cost functions, please consider using your
    chosen autodifferentiation framework directly, by chaining gradient computations:

    >>> qml.jacobian(qml.grad(cost))(weights)

    .. note::

        Currently, parametric gates are only supported if they obey a two-term shift rule,
        which includes the following operations:

        "RX", "RY", "RZ", "Rot", "PhaseShift", "ControlledPhaseShift", "MultiRZ", "PauliRot",
        "U1", "U2", "U3", "SingleExcitationMinus", "SingleExcitationPlus", "DoubleExcitationMinus",
        "DoubleExcitationPlus", "OrbitalRotation".

    Args:
        tape (pennylane.QNode or .QuantumTape): quantum tape or QNode to differentiate
        f0 (tensor_like[float] or None): Output of the evaluated input tape. If provided,
            and the Hessian tapes include the original input tape, the 'f0' value is used
            instead of evaluating the input tape, reducing the number of device invocations.

    Returns:
        tensor_like or tuple[tensor_like] or tuple[list[QuantumTape], function]:

        - If the input is a QNode with a single trainable argument, a tensor representing the
          Hessian of size ``(*QNode output dimensions, *QNode input dimensions, *QNode input dimensions)``
          is returned.

        - If the input is a QNode with multiple trainable arguments, a tuple of Hessian tensors is
          returned, one for each argument.

        - If the input is a tape, a tuple containing the list of parameter-shifted tapes, and a
          post-processing function to be applied to the evaluated tapes, is returned.

        Note: By default a QNode with the keyword ``hybrid=True`` computes derivates with respect to
        QNode arguments, which can include classical computations on those arguments before they are
        passed to quantum operations. The "purely quantum" Hessian can instead be obtained with
        ``hybrid=False``, which is then computed with respect to the gate arguments and produces a
        result of shape ``(*QNode output dimensions, # gate arguments, # gate arguments)``.

    **Example**

    Applying the Hessian transform to a QNode computes its Hessian tensor:

    >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)
    >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
    ... def circuit(x):
    ...     qml.RX(x[0], wires=0)
    ...     qml.RY(x[1], wires=0)
    ...     return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
    >>> x = np.array([0.1, 0.2], requires_grad=True)
    >>> qml.gradients.param_shift_hessian(circuit)(x)
    tensor([[-0.97517033,  0.01983384],
            [ 0.01983384, -0.97517033]], requires_grad=True)

    .. UsageDetails::

        The Hessian transform can also be applied to a quantum tape, instead producing the
        parameter-shifted Hessian tapes and a post-processing function to combine execution
        results:

        >>> circuit(x)  # generate the QuantumTape inside the QNode
        >>> tape = circuit.qtape
        >>> hessian_tapes, postproc_fn = qml.gradients.param_shift_hessian(tape)
        >>> hessian_tapes
        [<JacobianTape: wires=[0], params=2>,
            <JacobianTape: wires=[0], params=2>,
            <JacobianTape: wires=[0], params=2>,
            <JacobianTape: wires=[0], params=2>,
            <JacobianTape: wires=[0], params=2>,
            <JacobianTape: wires=[0], params=2>,
            <JacobianTape: wires=[0], params=2>]
        >>> postproc_fn(qml.execute(hessian_tapes, dev, None))
        array([[-0.97517033,  0.01983384],
                [ 0.01983384, -0.97517033]])

        The Hessian tapes can be inspected via their draw function, which reveals the different
        gate arguments generated from parameter-shift rules:

        >>> for h_tape in hessian_tapes:
        ...     print(h_tape.draw())
