def expand_matrix(base_matrix, wires, wire_order=None, sparse_format="csr"):
    """Re-express a base matrix acting on a subspace defined by a set of wire labels
    according to a global wire order.

    Args:
        base_matrix (tensor_like): base matrix to expand
        wires (Iterable): wires determining the subspace that base matrix acts on; a base matrix of
            dimension :math:`2^n` acts on a subspace of :math:`n` wires
        wire_order (Iterable): global wire order, which has to contain all wire labels in ``wires``, but can also
            contain additional labels
        sparse_format (str): if the base matrix is a scipy sparse matrix then this is the string representing the
            preferred scipy sparse matrix format to cast the expanded matrix too

    Returns:
        tensor_like: expanded matrix

    **Example**

    If the wire order is ``None`` or identical to ``wires``, the original matrix gets returned:

    >>> base_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
    ...                         [5, 6, 7, 8],
    ...                         [9, 10, 11, 12],
    ...                         [13, 14, 15, 16]])
    >>> print(expand_matrix(base_matrix, wires=[0, 2], wire_order=[0, 2]))
    [[ 1  2  3  4]
     [ 5  6  7  8]
     [ 9 10 11 12]
     [13 14 15 16]]
    >>> print(expand_matrix(base_matrix, wires=[0, 2]))
    [[ 1  2  3  4]
     [ 5  6  7  8]
     [ 9 10 11 12]
     [13 14 15 16]]

    If the wire order is a permutation of ``wires``, the entries of the base matrix get permuted:

    >>> print(expand_matrix(base_matrix, wires=[0, 2], wire_order=[2, 0]))
    [[ 1  3  2  4]
     [ 9 11 10 12]
     [ 5  7  6  8]
     [13 15 14 16]]

    If the wire order contains wire labels not found in ``wires``, the matrix gets expanded:

    >>> print(expand_matrix(base_matrix, wires=[0, 2], wire_order=[0, 1, 2]))
    [[ 1  2  0  0  3  4  0  0]
     [ 5  6  0  0  7  8  0  0]
     [ 0  0  1  2  0  0  3  4]
     [ 0  0  5  6  0  0  7  8]
     [ 9 10  0  0 11 12  0  0]
     [13 14  0  0 15 16  0  0]
     [ 0  0  9 10  0  0 11 12]
     [ 0  0 13 14  0  0 15 16]]

    The method works with tensors from all autodifferentiation frameworks, for example:

    >>> base_matrix_torch = torch.tensor([[1., 2.],
    ...                                   [3., 4.]], requires_grad=True)
    >>> res = expand_matrix(base_matrix_torch, wires=["b"], wire_order=["a", "b"])
    >>> type(res)
    torch.Tensor
    >>> res.requires_grad
    True

    The method words with scipy sparse matrices, for example:

    >>> from scipy import sparse
    >>> mat = sparse.csr_matrix([[0, 1], [1, 0]])
    >>> qml.math.expand_matrix(mat, wires=[1], wire_order=[0,1]).toarray()
    array([[0., 1., 0., 0.],
           [1., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 1.],
           [0., 0., 1., 0.]])
