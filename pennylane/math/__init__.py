This package contains unified functions for framework-agnostic tensor and array
manipulation. Given the input tensor-like object, the call is dispatched
to the corresponding array manipulation framework, allowing for end-to-end
differentiation to be preserved.

.. warning::

    These functions are experimental, and only a subset of common functionality is supported.
    Furthermore, the names and behaviour of these functions may differ from similar
    functions in common frameworks; please refer to the function docstrings for more details.

The following frameworks are currently supported:

* NumPy
* Autograd
* TensorFlow
* PyTorch
* JAX
