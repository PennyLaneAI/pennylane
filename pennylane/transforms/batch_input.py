    """
    Transform a circuit to support an initial batch dimension for gate inputs.

    In a classical ML application one needs to batch the non-trainable inputs of the network.
    This function executes the same analogue for a quantum circuit:
    separate circuit executions are created for each input, which are then executed
    with the *same* trainable parameters.

    The batch dimension is assumed to be the first rank of the
    non trainable tensor object. For a rank 1 feature space, the shape needs to be ``(Nt, x)``
    where ``x`` indicates the dimension of the features and ``Nt`` being the number of examples
    within a batch.
    Based on `arXiv:2202.10471 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10471>`__.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumTape or Callable): Input quantum circuit to batch
        argnum (Sequence[int] or int): One or several index values indicating the position of the
            non-trainable batched parameters in the quantum tape.

    Returns:
        qnode (QNode) or quantum function (Callable) or tuple[List[QuantumTape], function]:

        The transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`. Executing this circuit
        will provide the batched results.
