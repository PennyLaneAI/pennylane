def defer_measurements(tape: QuantumTape, **kwargs) -> (Sequence[QuantumTape], Callable):
    """Quantum function transform that substitutes operations conditioned on
    measurement outcomes to controlled operations.

    This transform uses the `deferred measurement principle
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Measurement_Principle>`_ and
    applies to qubit-based quantum functions.

    Support for mid-circuit measurements is device-dependent. If a device
    doesn't support mid-circuit measurements natively, then the QNode will
    apply this transform.

    .. note::

        The transform uses the :func:`~.ctrl` transform to implement operations
        controlled on mid-circuit measurement outcomes. The set of operations
        that can be controlled as such depends on the set of operations
        supported by the chosen device.

    .. note::

        Devices that inherit from :class:`~pennylane.QubitDevice` **must** be initialized
        with an additional wire for each mid-circuit measurement after which the measured
        wire is reused or reset for ``defer_measurements`` to transform the quantum tape
        correctly. Hence, devices and quantum tapes must also be initialized without custom
        wire labels for correct behaviour.

    .. note::

        This transform does not change the list of terminal measurements returned by
        the quantum function.

    .. note::

        When applying the transform on a quantum function that contains the
        :class:`~.Snapshot` instruction, state information corresponding to
        simulating the transformed circuit will be obtained. No
        post-measurement states are considered.

    .. warning::

        :func:`~.pennylane.state` is not supported with the ``defer_measurements`` transform.
        Additionally, :func:`~.pennylane.probs`, :func:`~.pennylane.sample` and
        :func:`~.pennylane.counts` can only be used with ``defer_measurements`` if wires
        or an observable are explicitly specified.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumTape or Callable): a quantum circuit.

    Returns:
        qnode (QNode) or quantum function (Callable) or tuple[List[QuantumTape], function]: The transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.

    **Example**

    Suppose we have a quantum function with mid-circuit measurements and
    conditional operations:

    .. code-block:: python3

        def qfunc(par):
            qml.RY(0.123, wires=0)
            qml.Hadamard(wires=1)
            m_0 = qml.measure(1)
            qml.cond(m_0, qml.RY)(par, wires=0)
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

    The ``defer_measurements`` transform allows executing such quantum
    functions without having to perform mid-circuit measurements:

    >>> dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=2)
    >>> transformed_qfunc = qml.defer_measurements(qfunc)
    >>> qnode = qml.QNode(transformed_qfunc, dev)
    >>> par = np.array(np.pi/2, requires_grad=True)
    >>> qnode(par)
    tensor(0.43487747, requires_grad=True)

    We can also differentiate parameters passed to conditional operations:

    >>> qml.grad(qnode)(par)
    tensor(-0.49622252, requires_grad=True)

    Reusing and reseting measured wires will work as expected with the
    ``defer_measurements`` transform:

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def func(x, y):
            qml.RY(x, wires=0)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            m_0 = qml.measure(1, reset=True)

            qml.cond(m_0, qml.RY)(y, wires=0)
            qml.RX(np.pi/4, wires=1)
            return qml.probs(wires=[0, 1])

    Executing this QNode:

    >>> pars = np.array([0.643, 0.246], requires_grad=True)
    >>> func(*pars)
    tensor([0.76960924, 0.13204407, 0.08394415, 0.01440254], requires_grad=True)
