def adjoint(fn):
    """Create a function that applies the adjoint (inverse) of the provided operation or template.

    This transform can be used to apply the adjoint of an arbitrary sequence of operations.

    Args:
        fn (function): A quantum function that applies quantum operations.

    Returns:
        function: A new function that will apply the same operations but adjointed and in reverse order.

    **Example**

    The adjoint transforms can be used within a QNode to apply the adjoint of
    any quantum function. Consider the following quantum function, that applies two
    operations:

    .. code-block:: python3

        def my_ops(a, b, wire):
            qml.RX(a, wires=wire)
            qml.RY(b, wires=wire)

    We can create a QNode that applies this quantum function,
    followed by the adjoint of this function:

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=1)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(a, b):
            my_ops(a, b, wire=0)
            qml.adjoint(my_ops)(a, b, wire=0)
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

    Printing this out, we can see that the inverse quantum
    function has indeed been applied:

    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)(0.2, 0.5))
     0: ──RX(0.2)──RY(0.5)──RY(-0.5)──RX(-0.2)──┤ ⟨Z⟩

    The adjoint function can also be applied directly to templates and operations:

    >>> qml.adjoint(qml.RX)(0.123, wires=0)
    >>> qml.adjoint(qml.templates.StronglyEntanglingLayers)(weights, wires=[0, 1])

    .. UsageDetails::

        **Adjoint of a function**

        Here, we apply the ``subroutine`` function, and then apply its inverse.
        Notice that in addition to adjointing all of the operations, they are also
        applied in reverse construction order.

        .. code-block:: python3

            def subroutine(wire):
                qml.RX(0.123, wires=wire)
                qml.RY(0.456, wires=wire)

            dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=1)
            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit():
                subroutine(0)
                qml.adjoint(subroutine)(0)
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

        This creates the following circuit:

        >>> circuit()
        >>> print(circuit.draw())
        0: --RX(0.123)--RY(0.456)--RY(-0.456)--RX(-0.123)--| <Z>

        **Single operation**

        You can also easily adjoint a single operation just by wrapping it with ``adjoint``:

        .. code-block:: python3

            dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=1)
            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def circuit():
                qml.RX(0.123, wires=0)
                qml.adjoint(qml.RX)(0.123, wires=0)
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

        This creates the following circuit:

        >>> circuit()
        >>> print(circuit.draw())
        0: --RX(0.123)--RX(-0.123)--| <Z>
