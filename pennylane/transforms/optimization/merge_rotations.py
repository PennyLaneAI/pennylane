def merge_rotations(tape):
    """Quantum function transform to combine rotation gates of the same type
    that act sequentially.

    If the combination of two rotation produces an angle that is close to 0,
    neither gate will be applied.

    Args:
        tape (.QuantumTape): A quantum tape.

    **Example**

    Consider the following quantum function.

    .. code-block:: python

        def qfunc(x, y, z):
            qml.RX(x, wires=0)
            qml.RX(y, wires=0)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 2])
            qml.RY(y, wires=1)
            qml.Hadamard(wires=2)
            qml.CRZ(z, wires=[2, 0])
            qml.RY(-y, wires=1)
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

    The circuit before optimization:

    >>> dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=3)
    >>> qnode = qml.QNode(qfunc, dev)
    >>> print(qml.draw(qnode)(1, 2, 3))
    0: ───RX(1)──RX(2)──────────╭RZ(3)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
    1: ──╭C──────RY(2)──RY(-2)──│───────┤
    2: ──╰X──────H──────────────╰C──────┤

    By inspection, we can combine the two ``RX`` rotations on the first qubit.
    On the second qubit, we have a cumulative angle of 0, and the gates will cancel.

    >>> optimized_qfunc = merge_rotations(qfunc)
    >>> optimized_qnode = qml.QNode(optimized_qfunc, dev)
    >>> print(qml.draw(optimized_qnode)(1, 2, 3))
    0: ───RX(3)─────╭RZ(3)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
    1: ──╭C─────────│───────┤
    2: ──╰X──────H──╰C──────┤
