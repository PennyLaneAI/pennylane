@qfunc_transform
def merge_rotations(tape, atol=1e-8, include_gates=None):
    r"""Quantum function transform to combine rotation gates of the same type
    that act sequentially.

    If the combination of two rotation produces an angle that is close to 0,
    neither gate will be applied.

    Args:
        qfunc (function): A quantum function.
        atol (float): After fusion of gates, if the fused angle :math:`\theta` is such that
            :math:`|\theta|\leq \text{atol}`, no rotation gate will be applied.
        include_gates (None or list[str]): A list of specific operations to merge. If
            set to ``None`` (default), all operations with the ``is_composable_rotation``
            attribute set to ``True`` will be merged. Otherwise, only the operations whose
            names match those in the list will undergo merging.

    Returns:
        function: the transformed quantum function

    **Example**

    Consider the following quantum function.

    .. code-block:: python

        def qfunc(x, y, z):
            qml.RX(x, wires=0)
            qml.RX(y, wires=0)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 2])
            qml.RY(y, wires=1)
            qml.Hadamard(wires=2)
            qml.CRZ(z, wires=[2, 0])
            qml.RY(-y, wires=1)
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

    The circuit before optimization:

    >>> dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=3)
    >>> qnode = qml.QNode(qfunc, dev)
    >>> print(qml.draw(qnode)(1, 2, 3))
     0: ───RX(1)──RX(2)──────────╭RZ(3)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
     1: ──╭C──────RY(2)──RY(-2)──│───────┤
     2: ──╰X──────H──────────────╰C──────┤

    By inspection, we can combine the two ``RX`` rotations on the first qubit.
    On the second qubit, we have a cumulative angle of 0, and the gates will cancel.

    >>> optimized_qfunc = merge_rotations()(qfunc)
    >>> optimized_qnode = qml.QNode(optimized_qfunc, dev)
    >>> print(qml.draw(optimized_qnode)(1, 2, 3))
     0: ───RX(3)─────╭RZ(3)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
     1: ──╭C─────────│───────┤
     2: ──╰X──────H──╰C──────┤

    It is also possible to explicitly specify which rotations ``merge_rotations`` should
    be merged using the ``include_gates`` argument. For example, if in the above
    circuit we wanted only to merge the "RX" gates, we could do so as follows:

    >>> optimized_qfunc = merge_rotations(include_gates=["RX"])(qfunc)
    >>> optimized_qnode = qml.QNode(optimized_qfunc, dev)
    >>> print(qml.draw(optimized_qnode)(1, 2, 3))
     0: ───RX(3)─────────────────╭RZ(3)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
     1: ──╭C──────RY(2)──RY(-2)──│───────┤
     2: ──╰X──────H──────────────╰C──────┤
