    Consider the following quantum function.

    Diagonal gates on either side of control qubits do not affect the outcome
    of controlled gates; thus we can push all the single-qubit gates on the
    first qubit together on the right (and fuse them if desired). Similarly, X
    gates commute with the target of ``CNOT`` and ``Toffoli`` (and ``PauliY``
    with ``CRY``). We can use the transform to push single-qubit gates as
    far as possible through the controlled operations:

    >>> optimized_qfunc = commute_controlled(direction="right")(qfunc)
    >>> optimized_qnode = qml.QNode(optimized_qfunc, dev)
