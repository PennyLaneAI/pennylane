        Diagonal gates on either side of control qubits do not affect the outcome
        of controlled gates; thus we can push all the single-qubit gates on the
        first qubit together on the right (and fuse them if desired). Similarly, X
        gates commute with the target of ``CNOT`` and ``Toffoli`` (and ``PauliY``
        with ``CRY``). We can use the transform to push single-qubit gates as
        far as possible through the controlled operations:

        >>> optimized_qfunc = commute_controlled(qfunc, direction="right")
        >>> optimized_qnode = qml.QNode(optimized_qfunc, dev)
