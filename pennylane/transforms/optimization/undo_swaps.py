@qfunc_transform
def undo_swaps(tape):
    """Quantum function transform to remove SWAP gates by running from right
    to left through the circuit changing the position of the qubits accordingly.

    Args:
        qfunc (function): A quantum function.

    Returns:
        function: the transformed quantum function

    **Example**

    Consider the following quantum function:

    .. code-block:: python

        def qfunc():
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.PauliX(wires=1)
            qml.SWAP(wires=[0,1])
            qml.SWAP(wires=[0,2])
            qml.PauliY(wires=0)
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

    The circuit before optimization:

    >>> dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=3)
    >>> qnode = qml.QNode(qfunc, dev)
    >>> print(qml.draw(qnode)())
        0: ──H──╭SWAP──╭SWAP──Y──┤ ⟨Z⟩
        1: ──X──╰SWAP──│─────────┤
        2: ────────────╰SWAP─────┤


    We can remove the SWAP gates by running the ``undo_swap`` transform:

    >>> optimized_qfunc = undo_swaps(qfunc)
    >>> optimized_qnode = qml.QNode(optimized_qfunc, dev)
    >>> print(qml.draw(optimized_qnode)(1, 2))
        0: ──Y──┤ ⟨Z⟩
        1: ──H──┤
        2: ──X──┤
