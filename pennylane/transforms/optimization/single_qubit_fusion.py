def single_qubit_fusion(
    tape: QuantumTape, atol=1e-8, exclude_gates=None
) -> (Sequence[QuantumTape], Callable):
    r"""Quantum function transform to fuse together groups of single-qubit
    operations into a general single-qubit unitary operation (:class:`~.Rot`).

    Fusion is performed only between gates that implement the property
    ``single_qubit_rot_angles``. Any sequence of two or more single-qubit gates
    (on the same qubit) with that property defined will be fused into one ``Rot``.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumTape or Callable): A quantum circuit.
        atol (float): An absolute tolerance for which to apply a rotation after
            fusion. After fusion of gates, if the fused angles :math:`\theta` are such that
            :math:`|\theta|\leq \text{atol}`, no rotation gate will be applied.
        exclude_gates (None or list[str]): A list of gates that should be excluded
            from full fusion. If set to ``None``, all single-qubit gates that can
            be fused will be fused.

    Returns:
        qnode (QNode) or quantum function (Callable) or tuple[List[QuantumTape], function]: The transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.

    **Example**

    >>> dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=1)

    You can apply the transform directly on :class:`QNode`:

    .. code-block:: python

        @single_qubit_fusion
        @qml.qnode(device=dev)
        def qfunc(r1, r2):
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.Rot(*r1, wires=0)
            qml.Rot(*r2, wires=0)
            qml.RZ(r1[0], wires=0)
            qml.RZ(r2[0], wires=0)
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliX(0))

    The single qubit gates are fused before execution.

    .. details::
        :title: Usage Details

        Consider the following quantum function.

        .. code-block:: python

            def qfunc(r1, r2):
                qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
                qml.Rot(*r1, wires=0)
                qml.Rot(*r2, wires=0)
                qml.RZ(r1[0], wires=0)
                qml.RZ(r2[0], wires=0)
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliX(0))

        The circuit before optimization:

        >>> qnode = qml.QNode(qfunc, dev)
        >>> print(qml.draw(qnode)([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]))
        0: ──H──Rot(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)──Rot(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)──RZ(0.1)──RZ(0.4)──┤ ⟨X⟩

        Full single-qubit gate fusion allows us to collapse this entire sequence into a
        single ``qml.Rot`` rotation gate.

        >>> optimized_qfunc = single_qubit_fusion(qfunc)
        >>> optimized_qnode = qml.QNode(optimized_qfunc, dev)
        >>> print(qml.draw(optimized_qnode)([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]))
        0: ──Rot(3.57, 2.09, 2.05)──┤ ⟨X⟩
