    .. details::
        :title: Usage Details

        You can also apply it on quantum functions:

        .. code-block:: python

            def qfunc(x, y, z):
                qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
                qml.Hadamard(wires=1)
                qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
                qml.RX(x, wires=2)
                qml.RY(y, wires=1)
                qml.PauliX(wires=1)
                qml.RZ(z, wires=0)
                qml.RX(y, wires=2)
                qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 2])
                qml.PauliX(wires=1)
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

        The circuit before optimization:

        >>> qnode = qml.QNode(qfunc, dev)
        >>> print(qml.draw(qnode)(1, 2, 3))
        0: ──H─────────H─────────RZ(3.00)─╭●────┤  <Z>
        1: ──H─────────RY(2.00)──X────────│───X─┤
        2: ──RX(1.00)──RX(2.00)───────────╰X────┤

        We can see that there are two adjacent Hadamards on the first qubit that
        should cancel each other out. Similarly, there are two Pauli-X gates on the
        second qubit that should cancel. We can obtain a simplified circuit by running
        the ``cancel_inverses`` transform:

        >>> optimized_qfunc = cancel_inverses(qfunc)
        >>> optimized_qnode = qml.QNode(optimized_qfunc, dev)
        >>> print(qml.draw(optimized_qnode)(1, 2, 3))
        0: ──RZ(3.00)───────────╭●─┤  <Z>
        1: ──H─────────RY(2.00)─│──┤
        2: ──RX(1.00)──RX(2.00)─╰X─┤
