def cancel_inverses(tape):
    """Quantum function transform to remove any operations that are applied next to their
    (self-)inverse.

    Args:
        qfunc (function): A quantum function.

    Returns:
        function: the transformed quantum function

    **Example**

    Consider the following quantum function:

    .. code-block:: python

        def qfunc(x, y, z):
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.Hadamard(wires=1)
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.RX(x, wires=2)
            qml.RY(y, wires=1)
            qml.PauliX(wires=1)
            qml.RZ(z, wires=0)
            qml.RX(y, wires=2)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 2])
            qml.PauliX(wires=1)
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

    The circuit before optimization:

    >>> dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=3)
    >>> qnode = qml.QNode(qfunc, dev)
    >>> print(qml.draw(qnode)(1, 2, 3))
    0: ──H──────H──────RZ(3)─────╭C──┤ ⟨Z⟩
    1: ──H──────RY(2)──X──────X──│───┤
    2: ──RX(1)──RX(2)────────────╰X──┤

    We can see that there are two adjacent Hadamards on the first qubit that
    should cancel each other out. Similarly, there are two Pauli-X gates on the
    second qubit that should cancel. We can obtain a simplified circuit by running
    the ``cancel_inverses`` transform:

    >>> optimized_qfunc = cancel_inverses(qfunc)
    >>> optimized_qnode = qml.QNode(optimized_qfunc, dev)
    >>> print(qml.draw(optimized_qnode)(1, 2, 3))
    0: ──RZ(3)─────────╭C──┤ ⟨Z⟩
    1: ──H──────RY(2)──│───┤
    2: ──RX(1)──RX(2)──╰X──┤
