            ops2(params=[2.321, 1.111])
            return qml.state()

    The above code would be equivalent to

    .. code-block:: python3

            # ops1(params=[0.123, 0.456])

    .. Note::

        Some devices are able to take advantage of the inherient sparsity of a
        controlled operation. In those cases, it may be more efficient to use
        this transform rather than adding controls by hand. For devices that don't
        have special control support, the operation is expanded to add control wires
        to each underlying op individually.

        **Nesting Controls**

        The ``ctrl`` transform can be nested with itself arbitrarily.

        .. code-block:: python3

            # These two ops are equivalent.
            op1 = qml.ctrl(qml.ctrl(my_ops, 1), 2)
