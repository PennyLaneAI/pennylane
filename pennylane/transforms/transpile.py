    .. warning::

        This transform does not yet support measurements of Hamiltonians or tensor products of observables. If a circuit
        is passed which contains these types of measurements, a ``NotImplementedError`` will be raised.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumTape or Callable): A quantum tape.
        coupling_map (list[tuple(int, int)] or nx.Graph): Either a list of tuples(int, int) or an instance of

    Returns:
        qnode (QNode) or quantum function (Callable) or tuple[List[.QuantumTape], function]: The transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.

    **Example**

    Consider the following example circuit

    .. code-block:: python

        def circuit():
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            qml.CNOT(wires=[2, 3])
            qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 3])
            qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 2])
            qml.CNOT(wires=[2, 3])
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 3])
            return qml.probs(wires=[0, 1, 2, 3])

    which, before transpiling it looks like this:

    .. code-block:: text

        0: ──╭●──────────────╭●──╭┤ Probs
        1: ──╰X──╭●──╭●──────│───├┤ Probs
        2: ──╭●──│───╰X──╭●──│───├┤ Probs
        3: ──╰X──╰X──────╰X──╰X──╰┤ Probs

    Suppose we have a device which has connectivity constraints according to the graph:

    .. code-block:: text

        0 --- 1
        |     |
        2 --- 3

    We encode this in a coupling map as a list of the edges which are present in the graph, and then pass this, together
    with the circuit, to the transpile function to get a circuit which can be executed for the specified coupling map:

    >>> dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=[0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> transpiled_circuit = qml.transforms.transpile(circuit, coupling_map=[(0, 1), (1, 3), (3, 2), (2, 0)])
    >>> transpiled_qnode = qml.QNode(transpiled_circuit, dev)
    >>> print(qml.draw(transpiled_qnode)())
    0: ─╭●────────────────╭●─┤ ╭Probs
    1: ─╰X─╭●───────╭●────│──┤ ├Probs
    2: ─╭●─│──╭SWAP─│──╭X─╰X─┤ ├Probs
