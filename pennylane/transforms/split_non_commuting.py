    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumScript or Callable): The quantum circuit to be split.
        grouping_strategy (str): The strategy to use for computing disjoint groups of
            commuting observables, can be ``"default"``, ``"wires"``, ``"qwc"``,
            or ``None`` to disable grouping.
        shot_dist (str or Callable or None): The strategy to use for shot distribution
            over the disjoint groups of commuting observables. Values can be ``"uniform"``
            (evenly distributes the number of ``shots`` across all groups of commuting terms),
            ``"weighted"`` (distributes the number of ``shots`` according to weights proportional

            See Usage Details for more information.
        seed (Generator or int or None): A seed-like parameter used only when the shot distribution
            strategy involves a non-deterministic sampling process (e.g. ``"weighted_random"``).

    Raises:
        TypeError: if ``shot_dist`` is not a str or Callable or None.
        ValueError: if ``shot_dist`` is a str but not an available strategy.

    .. note::
        This transform splits expectation values of sums into separate terms, and also distributes the terms into
        multiple executions if there are terms that do not commute with one another. For state-based simulators
        that are able to handle non-commuting measurements in a single execution, but don't natively support sums
        of observables, consider :func:`split_to_single_terms <pennylane.transforms.split_to_single_terms>` instead.

    **Examples:**

    This transform allows us to transform a QNode measuring multiple observables into multiple
    circuit executions, each measuring a group of commuting observables.

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

        @qml.transforms.split_non_commuting
        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x):
            qml.RY(x[0], wires=0)
            qml.RX(x[1], wires=1)
            return [
                qml.expval(qml.X(0)),
                qml.expval(qml.Y(1)),
                qml.expval(qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(1)),
                qml.expval(qml.X(0) @ qml.Z(1) + 0.5 * qml.Y(1) + qml.Z(0)),
            ]

    Instead of decorating the QNode, we can also create a new function that yields the same
    result in the following way:

    .. code-block:: python3

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x):
            qml.RY(x[0], wires=0)
            qml.RX(x[1], wires=1)
            return [
                qml.expval(qml.X(0)),
                qml.expval(qml.Y(1)),
                qml.expval(qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(1)),
                qml.expval(qml.X(0) @ qml.Z(1) + 0.5 * qml.Y(1) + qml.Z(0)),
            ]

        circuit = qml.transforms.split_non_commuting(circuit)

    Internally, the QNode is split into multiple circuits when executed:

    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)([np.pi/4, np.pi/4]))
    0: ──RY(0.79)─┤  <X> ╭<X@Z>
    1: ──RX(0.79)─┤      ╰<X@Z>
    <BLANKLINE>
    0: ──RY(0.79)─┤
    1: ──RX(0.79)─┤  <Y>
    <BLANKLINE>
    0: ──RY(0.79)─┤ ╭<Z@Z>  <Z>
    1: ──RX(0.79)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>

    Note that the observable ``Y(1)`` occurs twice in the original QNode, but only once in the
    transformed circuits. When there are multiple expectation value measurements that rely on
    the same observable, this observable is measured only once, and the result is copied to each
    original measurement.

    While internally multiple tapes are created, the end result has the same ordering as the user
    provides in the return statement. Executing the above QNode returns the original ordering of
    the expectation values.

    >>> circuit([np.pi/4, np.pi/4])
    [0.7071067811865475,
     -0.7071067811865475,
     0.49999999999999994,
     0.8535533905932737]

    There are two algorithms used to compute disjoint groups of commuting observables: ``"qwc"``
    grouping uses :func:`~pennylane.pauli.group_observables` which computes groups of qubit-wise
    commuting observables, producing the fewest number of circuit executions, but can be expensive
    to compute for large multi-term Hamiltonians, while ``"wires"`` grouping simply ensures
    that no circuit contains two measurements with overlapping wires, disregarding commutativity
    between the observables being measured.

    The ``grouping_strategy`` keyword argument can be used to specify the grouping strategy. By
    default, qwc grouping is used whenever possible, except when the circuit contains multiple
    measurements that includes an expectation value of a ``qml.Hamiltonian``, in which case wires
    grouping is used in case the Hamiltonian is very large, to save on classical runtime. To force
    qwc grouping in all cases, set ``grouping_strategy="qwc"``. Similarly, to force wires grouping,
    set ``grouping_strategy="wires"``:

    .. code-block:: python3

        @functools.partial(qml.transforms.split_non_commuting, grouping_strategy="wires")
        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x):
            qml.RY(x[0], wires=0)
            qml.RX(x[1], wires=1)
            return [
                qml.expval(qml.X(0)),
                qml.expval(qml.Y(1)),
                qml.expval(qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(1)),
                qml.expval(qml.X(0) @ qml.Z(1) + 0.5 * qml.Y(1) + qml.Z(0)),
            ]

    In this case, four circuits are created as follows:

    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)([np.pi/4, np.pi/4]))
    0: ──RY(0.79)─┤  <X>
    1: ──RX(0.79)─┤  <Y>
    <BLANKLINE>
    0: ──RY(0.79)─┤ ╭<Z@Z>
    1: ──RX(0.79)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>
    <BLANKLINE>
    0: ──RY(0.79)─┤ ╭<X@Z>
    1: ──RX(0.79)─┤ ╰<X@Z>
    <BLANKLINE>
    0: ──RY(0.79)─┤  <Z>
    1: ──RX(0.79)─┤

    Alternatively, to disable grouping completely, set ``grouping_strategy=None``:

    .. code-block:: python3

        @functools.partial(qml.transforms.split_non_commuting, grouping_strategy=None)
        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x):
            qml.RY(x[0], wires=0)
            qml.RX(x[1], wires=1)
            return [
                qml.expval(qml.X(0)),
                qml.expval(qml.Y(1)),
                qml.expval(qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(1)),
                qml.expval(qml.X(0) @ qml.Z(1) + 0.5 * qml.Y(1) + qml.Z(0)),
            ]

    In this case, each observable is measured in a separate circuit execution.

    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)([np.pi/4, np.pi/4]))
    0: ──RY(0.79)─┤  <X>
    1: ──RX(0.79)─┤
    <BLANKLINE>
    0: ──RY(0.79)─┤
    1: ──RX(0.79)─┤  <Y>
    <BLANKLINE>
    0: ──RY(0.79)─┤ ╭<Z@Z>
    1: ──RX(0.79)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>
    <BLANKLINE>
    0: ──RY(0.79)─┤ ╭<X@Z>
    1: ──RX(0.79)─┤ ╰<X@Z>
    <BLANKLINE>
    0: ──RY(0.79)─┤  <Z>
    1: ──RX(0.79)─┤

    Note that there is an exception to the above rules: if the circuit only contains a single
    expectation value measurement of a ``Hamiltonian`` or ``Sum`` with pre-computed grouping
    indices, the grouping information will be used regardless of the requested ``grouping_strategy``

        :title: Usage Details

        **Shot distribution**

        With finite-shot measurements, the default behaviour of ``split_non_commuting`` is to perform one
        execution with the total number of ``shots`` for each group of commuting terms. With the
        ``shot_dist`` argument, this behaviour can be changed. For example,
        ``shot_dist = "weighted"`` will partition the number of shots performed for
        each commuting group according to the L1 norm of each group's coefficients:

        .. code-block:: python3

            import pennylane as qml
            from pennylane.transforms import split_non_commuting
            from functools import partial

            ham = qml.Hamiltonian(
                coeffs=[10, 0.1, 20, 100, 0.2],
                observables=[
                    qml.X(0) @ qml.Y(1),
                    qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(2),
                    qml.Y(1),
                    qml.X(1) @ qml.X(2),
                    qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(1) @ qml.Z(2)
                ]
            )

            dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

            @partial(split_non_commuting, shot_dist="weighted")
            @qml.qnode(dev, shots=10000)
            def circuit():
                return qml.expval(ham)

            with qml.Tracker(dev) as tracker:
                circuit()

        >>> print(tracker.history["shots"])
        [2303, 23, 7674]

        The ``shot_dist`` strategy can be also defined by a custom function. For example:

        .. code-block:: python3

            import numpy as np

            def my_shot_dist(total_shots, coeffs_per_group, seed):
                max_per_group = [np.max(np.abs(coeffs)) for coeffs in coeffs_per_group]
                prob_shots = np.array(max_per_group) / np.sum(max_per_group)
                return np.round(total_shots * prob_shots)

            @partial(split_non_commuting, shot_dist=my_shot_dist)
            @qml.qnode(dev, shots=10000)
            def circuit():
                return qml.expval(ham)

            with qml.Tracker(dev) as tracker:
                circuit()

        >>> print(tracker.history["shots"])
        [1664, 17, 8319]

        **Internal details**

        Internally, this function works with tapes. We can create a tape with multiple
        measurements of non-commuting observables:

        .. code-block:: python3

            measurements = [
                qml.expval(qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(1)),
                qml.expval(qml.X(0) @ qml.X(1)),
                qml.expval(qml.Z(0)),
                qml.expval(qml.X(0))
            ]
            tape = qml.tape.QuantumScript(measurements=measurements)
            tapes, processing_fn = qml.transforms.split_non_commuting(tape)

        Now ``tapes`` is a list of two tapes, each contains a group of commuting observables:

        >>> [t.measurements for t in tapes]
        [[expval(Z(0) @ Z(1)), expval(Z(0))], [expval(X(0) @ X(1)), expval(X(0))]]

        The processing function becomes important as the order of the inputs has been modified.

        >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)
        >>> result_batch = [dev.execute(t) for t in tapes]
        >>> result_batch
        [(1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 0.0)]

        The processing function can be used to reorganize the results:

        >>> processing_fn(result_batch)
        (1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0)

        Measurements that accept both observables and ``wires`` so that e.g. ``qml.counts``,
        ``qml.probs`` and ``qml.sample`` can also be used. When initialized using only ``wires``,
        these measurements are interpreted as measuring with respect to the observable
        ``qml.Z(wires[0])@qml.Z(wires[1])@...@qml.Z(wires[len(wires)-1])``

        .. code-block:: python3

            measurements = [
                qml.expval(qml.X(0)),
                qml.probs(wires=[1]),
                qml.probs(wires=[0, 1])
            ]
            tape = qml.tape.QuantumScript(measurements=measurements)
            tapes, processing_fn = qml.transforms.split_non_commuting(tape)

        This results in two tapes, each with commuting measurements:

        >>> [t.measurements for t in tapes]
        [[expval(X(0)), probs(wires=[1])], [probs(wires=[0, 1])]]
