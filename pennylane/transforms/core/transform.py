def transform(quantum_transform, expand_transform=None, classical_cotransform=None):
    """The transform function is to be used to validate and dispatch a quantum transform on PennyLane objects (tape,
    qfunc and Qnode). It can be used directly as a decorator on qfunc and qnodes.

    Args:
        quantum_transform(callable): A quantum transform is defined as a function that has the following requirements:

            * A quantum transform is a function that takes a quantum tape as first input and returns a sequence of tapes
              and a processing function.

            * The transform must have type hinting of the following form: my_quantum_transform(tape:
              qml.tape.QuantumTape, ...) -> ( Sequence[qml.tape.QuantumTape], callable)

        expand_transform(callable): An expand transform is defined as a function that has the following requirements:

            * An expand transform is a function that is applied before applying the defined quantum transform. It
              takes a quantum tape as single input and returns a single tape in a sequence with a dummy processing
              function, lambda x: x.

            * The expand transform must have the same type hinting as a quantum transform.

        classical_cotransform(callable): A classical co-transform.

    **Example**

    First define your quantum_transform, with the necessary type hinting defined above. In this example we copy the
    tape and sum the results of the execution of the two tapes.

    .. code-block:: python

        def my_quantum_transform(tape: qml.tape.QuantumTape) -> (Sequence[qml.tape.QuantumTape], callable):
            tape1 = tape
            tape2 = tape.copy()

            def post_processing_fn(results):
                return qml.math.sum(results)

            return [tape1, tape2], post_processing_fn

    Of course, we want to be able to apply this transform on ``qfunc`` and ``qnodes``. That's where the ``transform`` function
    comes into play. This function validates the signature of your quantum transform and dispatches it on the different
    object. Let's define a circuit as a qfunc and as a qnode.

        .. code-block:: python

            def qfunc_circuit(a):
                qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
                qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
                qml.PauliX(wires=0)
                qml.RZ(a, wires=1)
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=0))

            dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

            @qml.qnode(device=dev)
            def qnode_circuit(a):
                qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
                qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
                qml.PauliX(wires=0)
                qml.RZ(a, wires=1)
                return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=0))

    >>> dispatched_transform = transform(my_quantum_transform)

    Now you can use the dispatched transform directly on qfunc and qnodes.

    For QNodes, the dispatched transform populates the ``TransformProgram`` of your QNode. The transform and its
    processing function are applied in the execution.

    >>> transformed_qnode = dispatched_transform(qfunc_circuit)
    <QNode: wires=2, device='default.qubit', interface='auto', diff_method='best'>

    One subtlety here, this transform would not work for a qfunc because our transform return more than one case. If
    it was not the case you would be able to dispatch on quantum functions.
