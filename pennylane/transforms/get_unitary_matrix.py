def get_unitary_matrix(circuit, wire_order=None):
    r"""Construct the matrix representation of a quantum circuit.

    Args:
        circuit (pennylane.QNode, .QuantumTape, or Callable): A quantum node, tape,
            or function that applies quantum operations.
        wire_order (Sequence[Any], optional): Order of the wires in the quantum circuit.
            Defaults to the order in which the wires appear in the quantum function.

    Returns:
         function: Function which accepts the same arguments as the QNode or quantum function.
         When called, this function will return the unitary matrix in the appropriate autodiff framework
         (Autograd, TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX) given its parameters.

    **Example**

    Consider the following function (the same applies for a QNode or tape):

    .. code-block:: python3

        def circuit(theta):
            qml.RX(theta, wires=1)
            qml.PauliZ(wires=0)


    We can use ``get_unitary_matrix`` to generate a new function
    that returns the unitary matrix corresponding to the function ``circuit``:


    >>> get_matrix = get_unitary_matrix(circuit)
    >>> theta = np.pi / 4
    >>> get_matrix(theta)
    array([[ 0.92387953+0.j,  0.+0.j ,  0.-0.38268343j,  0.+0.j],
       [ 0.+0.j,  -0.92387953+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0. +0.38268343j],
       [ 0. -0.38268343j,  0.+0.j,  0.92387953+0.j,  0.+0.j],
       [ 0.+0.j,  0.+0.38268343j,  0.+0.j,  -0.92387953+0.j]])


    Note that since ``wire_order`` was not specified, the default order ``[1, 0]``
    for ``circuit`` was used, and the unitary matrix corresponds to the operation
    :math:`Z\otimes R_X(\theta)`. To obtain the matrix for :math:`R_X(\theta)\otimes Z`,
    specify ``wire_order=[0, 1]`` in the function call:

    >>> get_matrix = get_unitary_matrix(circuit, wire_order=[0, 1])

    You can also get the unitary matrix for operations on a subspace of a
    larger Hilbert space. For example, with the same function ``circuit`` and
    ``wire_order=["a", 0, "b", 1]`` you obtain the :math:`16\times 16` matrix for
    the operation :math:`I\otimes Z\otimes I\otimes  R_X(\theta)`.

    This unitary matrix can also be used in differentiable calculations.
    For example, consider the following cost function:

    .. code-block:: python

        def circuit(theta):
            qml.RX(theta, wires=1)
            qml.PauliZ(wires=0)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])

        def cost(theta):
            matrix = get_unitary_matrix(circuit)(theta)
            return np.real(np.trace(matrix))

    Since this cost function returns a real scalar as a function of ``theta``,
    we can differentiate it:

    >>> theta = np.array(0.3, requires_grad=True)
    >>> cost(theta)
    1.9775421558720845
    >>> qml.grad(cost)(theta)
    -0.14943813247359922
