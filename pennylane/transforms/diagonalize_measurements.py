    """Diagonalize a set of measurements into the standard basis. Raises an error if the
    measurements do not commute.

    See the usage details for more information on which measurements are supported.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumScript or Callable): The quantum circuit to modify the measurements of.
        supported_base_obs (Optional, Iterable(Observable)): A list of supported base observable classes.
            Allowed observables are ``qml.X``, ``qml.Y``, ``qml.Z``, ``qml.Hadamard`` and ``qml.Identity``.
            Z and Identity are always treated as supported, regardless of input. If no list is provided,
            the transform will diagonalize everything into the Z basis. If a list is provided, only
            unsupported observables will be diagonalized to the Z basis.

    Returns:
        qnode (QNode) or tuple[List[QuantumScript], function]: The transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.

    .. note::
        An error will be raised if non-commuting terms are encountered. To avoid non-commuting
        terms in circuit measurements, the :func:`split_non_commuting <pennylane.transforms.split_non_commuting>`
        transform can be applied.

        This transform will diagonalize what it can, i.e., ``qml.X``, ``qml.Y``, ``qml.Z``,
        ``qml.Hadamard``, ``qml.Identity``, or a linear combination of them. Any unrecognized
        observable will not raise an error, deferring to the device's validation for supported
        measurements later on. Lastly, if ``diagonalize_measurements`` produces additional gates
        that the device does not support, the :func:`~pennylane.devices.preprocess.decompose`
        transform should be applied to ensure that the additional gates are decomposed to those
        that the device supports.

    **Examples:**

    This transform allows us to transform QNode measurements into the measurement basis by adding
    the relevant diagonalizing gates to the end of the tape operations.

    .. code-block:: python3

        from pennylane.transforms import diagonalize_measurements

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

        @diagonalize_measurements
        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x):
            qml.RY(x[0], wires=0)
            qml.RX(x[1], wires=1)
            return qml.expval(qml.X(0) @ qml.Z(1)), qml.var(0.5 * qml.Y(2) + qml.X(0))

    Applying the transform appends the relevant gates to the end of the circuit to allow
    measurements to be in the Z basis, so the original circuit

    becomes

    .. details::
        :title: Usage Details

        The transform diagonalizes observables from the local Pauli basis only, i.e. it diagonalizes
        X, Y, Z, and Hadamard. Any other observable will be unaffected:

        .. code-block:: python3

            measurements = [
                qml.expval(qml.X(0) + qml.Hermitian([[1, 0], [0, 1]], wires=[1]))
            ]
            tape = qml.tape.QuantumScript(measurements=measurements)
            tapes, processsing_fn = diagonalize_measurements(tape)

        >>> tapes[0].operations
        [H(0)]
        >>> tapes[0].measurements
        [expval(Z(0) + Hermitian(array([[1, 0], [0, 1]]), wires=[1]))]

        The transform can also diagonalize only a subset of these operators. By default, the only
        supported base observable is Z. What if a backend device can handle
        X, Y and Z, but doesn't provide support for Hadamard? We can set this by passing
        ``supported_base_obs`` to the transform. Let's create a tape with some measurements:

        .. code-block:: python3

            measurements = [
                qml.expval(qml.X(0) + qml.Hadamard(1)),
                qml.expval(qml.X(0) + 0.2 * qml.Hadamard(1)),
                qml.var(qml.Y(2) + qml.X(0)),
            ]
            tape = qml.tape.QuantumScript(measurements=measurements)
            tapes, processing_fn = diagonalize_measurements(
                tape,
                supported_base_obs=[qml.X, qml.Y, qml.Z]
            )

        Now ``tapes`` is a tuple containing a single tape with the updated measurements,
        where only the Hadamard gate has been diagonalized:

        >>> tapes[0].measurements
        [expval(X(0) + Z(1)), expval(X(0) + 0.2 * Z(1)), var(Y(2) + X(0))]
