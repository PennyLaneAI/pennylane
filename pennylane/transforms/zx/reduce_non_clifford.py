def reduce_non_clifford(tape: QuantumScript) -> tuple[QuantumScriptBatch, PostprocessingFn]:
    """Reduce the number of non-Clifford gates by applying a combination of phase gadgetization strategies
    and Clifford gate simplification rules.

    This transform performs the following simplification/optimization steps:

    - Apply the `full_reduce <https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyzx.simplify.full_reduce>`__
      simplification pipeline to the ``pyzx`` graph representation (see :func:`~.to_zx`) of the given input circuit.

    - Use the `extract_circuit <https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyzx.extract.extract_circuit>`__
      function to extract the equivalent sequence of gates and build a new optimized circuit.

    - Apply the `basic_optimization <https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyzx.optimize.basic_optimization>`__ pass
      to further optimize the phase-polynomial blocks in the circuit.

    This pipeline does not run the Third Order Duplicate and Destroy (TODD) algorithm and thus is not restricted to Clifford + T circuits.

    .. note::

        The transformed output circuit is equivalent to the input up to a global phase.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumScript or Callable): the input circuit to be transformed.

    Returns:
        qnode (QNode) or quantum function (Callable) or tuple[List[QuantumScript], function]:
        the transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.

    Raises:
        ModuleNotFoundError: if the required ``pyzx`` package is not installed.

    **Example:**

    .. code-block:: python3

        import pennylane as qml
        import pennylane.transforms.zx as zx

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

        @zx.reduce_non_clifford
        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x, y):
            qml.T(0)
            qml.Hadamard(0)
            qml.Hadamard(0)
            qml.CNOT([0, 1])
            qml.T(0)
            qml.RX(x, 1)
            qml.RX(y, 1)
            return qml.state()


    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)(3.2, -2.2))
        0: ──S─╭●─────────────────┤  State
        1: ────╰X──H──RZ(1.00)──H─┤  State


    .. note::

        This transform is designed to minimize non-Clifford phase gates (e.g. ``T``, ``RZ``),
        and is not as effective at reducing the number of two-qubit gates (e.g. ``CNOT``).
        For example, you might see a substantial increase in CNOT gates when optimizing a circuit composed primarily of Toffoli gates.
        Conversely, it tends to perform quite well on Trotterized chemistry circuits.
