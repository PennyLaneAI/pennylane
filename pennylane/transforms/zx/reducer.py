def zx_full_reduce(tape: QuantumScript) -> tuple[QuantumScriptBatch, PostprocessingFn]:
    """Reduce the circuit applying simplification rules based on the ZX calculus.

    This transform returns an equivalent reduced version of the given quantum circuit, performing
    a graph-theoretic simplification based on ZX calculus rules. It works as follows:

        - convert the quantum circuit into the corresponding ``pyzx`` graph;

        - apply ZX calculus simplification rules on the graph;

        - convert the simplified ``pyzx`` graph back to its quantum circuit representation.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumScript or Callable): the input circuit to be transformed.

    Returns:
        qnode (QNode) or quantum function (Callable) or tuple[List[QuantumScript], function]:
        the transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.

    Raises:
        ModuleNotFoundError: if the required ``pyzx`` Python package is not installed.

    **Example:**

    Consider the following QNode function as an example:

    .. code-block:: python3

        import pennylane as qml
        from pennylane.transforms import zx_full_reduce

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(x, y):
            qml.T(wires=0)
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0,1])
            qml.T(wires=0)
            qml.RX(x, wires=1)
            qml.RX(y, wires=1)
            return qml.state()

    To simplify the circuit using the ZX calculus rules you can do:

    >>> new_circuit = zx_full_reduce(circuit)
    >>> print(qml.draw(new_circuit)(3.2, -2.2))
    0: ──S─╭●─────────────────┤  State
    1: ────╰X──H──RZ(1.00)──H─┤  State

    You can check that the final state is matching the one returned by the original circuit by:

    >>> qml.math.allclose(circuit(3.2, -2.2), new_circuit(3.2, -2.2))
    True

    .. note::

        This transform is designed to minimize T-count, and is not as effective at reducing the
        number of two-qubit gates, such as CNOTs. However, its performance varies significantly
        depending on the type of circuit. For example, you might see a substantial increase in CNOT
        gates when optimizing a circuit composed primarily of Toffoli gates. Conversely, it tends
        to perform much better on Trotterized chemistry circuits.
