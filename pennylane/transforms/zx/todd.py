    """
    Apply the `Third Order Duplicate and Destroy (TODD) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01557>`__ algorithm to reduce
    the number of T gates in the given Clifford + T circuit.

    This transform optimizes a Clifford + T circuit by cutting it into phase-polynomial blocks,
    and using the TODD algorithm to optimize each of these phase polynomials.
    Depending on the number of qubits and T gates in the original circuit, it might take a long time to run.

    .. note::

        The transformed output circuit is equivalent to the input up to a global phase.

    The implementation is based on the
    `pyzx.phase_block_optimize <https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyzx.optimize.phase_block_optimize>`__ pass.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumScript or Callable): the input circuit to be transformed.

    Returns:
        qnode (QNode) or quantum function (Callable) or tuple[List[QuantumScript], function]:
        the transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.

    Raises:
        ModuleNotFoundError: if the required ``pyzx`` package is not installed.
        TypeError: if the input quantum circuit is not a Clifford + T circuit.

    **Example:**

    .. code-block:: python3

        import pennylane as qml
        import pennylane.transforms.zx as zx
