    Args:
        tape (QuantumScript): A circuit that may contain dynamic wire allocations and deallocations
        zeroed (Sequence[Hashable]): a register of wires known to be the zero state
        any_state (Sequence[Hashable]): a register of wires with any state
        min_int (Optional[int]): If not ``None``, new wire labels can be created starting at this

    Returns:
        tuple[QuantumScript], Callable[[ResultBatch], Result]: A batch of tapes and a postprocessing function

    .. note::

        This transform currently uses a "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) stack based approach to distributing wires.
        This minimizes the total number of wires used, at the cost of higher depth and more resets. Other
        approaches could be taken as well, such as a "First In, First out" algorithm that minimizes depth.

        This approach also means we pop wires from the *end* of the stack first.

    For a dynamic wire requested to be in the zero state (``require_zeros=True``), we try three things before erroring:

      #. If wires exist in the ``zeroed`` register, we take one from that register
      #. If no ``zeroed`` wires exist, we pull one from ``any_state`` and apply a reset operation
      #. If no wires exist in the ``zeroed`` or ``any_state`` registers and ``min_int`` is not ``None``,
         we increment ``min_int`` and add a new wire.

    For a dynamic wire with ``require_zeros=False``, we try:

      #. If wires exist in the ``any_state``, we take one from that register
      #. If no wires exist in ``any_state``, we pull one from ``zeroed``
      #. If no wires exist in the ``zeroed`` or ``any_state`` registers and ``min_int`` is not ``None``,
         we increment ``min_int`` and add a new wire

    This transform uses a combination of two different modes: one with fixed registers specified by ``zeroed`` and
    ``any_state``, and one with a dynamically sized register characterized by the integer ``min_int``.  We assume
    that the upfront cost associated with using more wires has already been paid for anything in ``zeroed`` and
    ``any_state``. Whether or not we use them, they will still be there. In this case, using a fresh wire is cheaper
    than reset.  For the dynamically sized register, we assume that we have to pay an
    additional cost each time we allocate a new wire. For the dynamically sized register, applying a reset
    operation is therefor cheaper than allocating a new wire.

    This approach minimizes the width of the circuit at the cost of more reset operations.

    .. code-block:: python

        def circuit(require_zeros=True):
            with qml.allocation.allocate(1, require_zeros=require_zeros) as wires:
                qml.X(wires)
            with qml.allocation.allocate(1, require_zeros=require_zeros) as wires:
                qml.Y(wires)

    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())
    <DynamicWire>: ──Allocate──X──Deallocate─┤
    <DynamicWire>: ──Allocate──Y──Deallocate─┤

    If we provide two zeroed qubits to the transform, we can see that the two operations have been
    assigned to both wires known to be in the zero state.

    >>> from pennylane.transforms import resolve_dynamic_wires
    >>> assigned_two_zeroed = resolve_dynamic_wires(circuit, zeroed=("a", "b"))
    >>> print(qml.draw(assigned_two_zeroed)())
    a: ──Y─┤
    b: ──X─┤

    If we only provide one zeroed wire, we perform a reset on that wire before reusing for the ``Y`` operation.

    >>> assigned_one_zeroed = resolve_dynamic_wires(circuit, zeroed=("a",))
    >>> print(qml.draw(assigned_one_zeroed)())
    a: ──X──┤↗│  │0⟩──Y─┤

    If we only provide ``any_state`` qubits with unknown states, then they will be reset to zero before being used
    in an operation that requires a zero state.

    >>> assigned_any_state = resolve_dynamic_wires(circuit, any_state=("a", "b"))
    >>> print(qml.draw(assigned_any_state)())
    b: ──┤↗│  │0⟩──X──┤↗│  │0⟩──Y─|

    Note that the last provided wire with label ``"b"`` is used first.
    If the wire allocations had ``require_zeros=False``, no reset operations would occur:

    >>> print(qml.draw(assigned_any_state)(require_zeros=False))
    b: ──X──Y─┤

    Instead of registers of available wires, a ``min_int`` can be specified instead.  The ``min_int`` indicates
    the first integer to start allocating wires to.  Whenever we have no qubits available to allocate, we increment the integer
    and add a new wire to the pool:

    >>> circuit_integers = resolve_dynamic_wires(circuit, min_int=0)
    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit_integers)())
    0: ──X──┤↗│  │0⟩──Y─┤

    Note that we still prefer using already created wires over creating new wires.

    .. code-block:: python

        def multiple_allocations():
            with qml.allocation.allocate(1) as wires:
                qml.X(wires)
            with qml.allocation.allocate(3) as wires:
                qml.Toffoli(wires)

    >>> circuit_integers2 = resolve_dynamic_wires(multiple_allocations, min_int=0)
    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit_integers2)())
    0: ──X──┤↗│  │0⟩─╭●─┤
    1: ──────────────├●─┤
    2: ──────────────╰X─┤

    If both an explicit register and ``min_int`` are specified, ``min_int`` will be used once all available
    explicit wires are loaned out. Below, ``"a"`` is extracted and used first, but then wires
    are extracted starting from ``0``.

    >>> zeroed_and_min_int = resolve_dynamic_wires(multiple_allocations, zeroed=("a",), min_int=0)
    >>> print(qml.draw(zeroed_and_min_int)())
    a: ──X──┤↗│  │0⟩─╭●─┤
    0: ──────────────├●─┤
    1: ──────────────╰X─┤
