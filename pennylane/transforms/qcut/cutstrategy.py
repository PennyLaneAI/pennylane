    """
    A circuit-cutting distribution policy for executing (large) circuits on available (comparably
    smaller) devices.

    .. note::

        This class is part of a work-in-progress feature to support automatic cut placement in the
        circuit cutting workflow. Currently only manual placement of cuts is supported,
        check out the :func:`qml.cut_circuit() <pennylane.cut_circuit>` transform for more details.

    Args:
        devices (Union[qml.Device, Sequence[qml.Device]]): Single, or Sequence of, device(s).
            Optional only when ``max_free_wires`` is provided.
        max_free_wires (int): Number of wires for the largest available device. Optional only when
            ``devices`` is provided where it defaults to the maximum number of wires among
            ``devices``.
        min_free_wires (int): Number of wires for the smallest available device, or, equivalently,
            the smallest max fragment-wire-size that the partitioning is allowed to explore.
            When provided, this parameter will be used to derive an upper-bound to the range of
            explored number of fragments.  Optional, defaults to 2 which corresponds to attempting
            the most granular partitioning of max 2-wire fragments.
        num_fragments_probed (Union[int, Sequence[int]]): Single, or 2-Sequence of, number(s)
            specifying the potential (range of) number of fragments for the partitioner to attempt.
            Optional, defaults to probing all valid strategies derivable from the circuit and
            devices. When provided, has precedence over all other arguments affecting partitioning
            exploration, such as ``max_free_wires``, ``min_free_wires``, or ``exhaustive``.
        max_free_gates (int): Maximum allowed circuit depth for the deepest available device.
            Optional, defaults to unlimited depth.
        min_free_gates (int): Maximum allowed circuit depth for the shallowest available device.
            Optional, defaults to ``max_free_gates``.
        imbalance_tolerance (float): The global maximum allowed imbalance for all partition trials.
            Optional, defaults to unlimited imbalance. Used only if there's a known hard balancing
            constraint on the partitioning problem.
        trials_per_probe (int): Number of repeated partitioning trials for a random automatic
            cutting method to attempt per set of partitioning parameters. For a deterministic
            cutting method, this can be set to 1. Defaults to 4.

    **Example**

    The following cut strategy specifies that a circuit should be cut into between
    ``2`` to ``5`` fragments, with each fragment having at most ``6`` wires and
    at least ``4`` wires:

    >>> cut_strategy = qml.transforms.CutStrategy(
    ...     max_free_wires=6,
    ...     min_free_wires=4,
