Custom transforms
-----------------

:func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>` can be used to define custom transformations
that work with PennyLane QNodes; such transformations can map a circuit
to one or many new circuits alongside associated classical post-processing.

Decorators and utility functions
--------------------------------

The following decorators and convenience functions are provided
to help build custom QNode, quantum function, and tape transforms:

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~transforms.make_tape
    ~transforms.map_batch_transform
    ~transforms.create_expand_fn
    ~transforms.create_decomp_expand_fn
    ~transforms.expand_invalid_trainable
    ~transforms.expand_invalid_trainable_hadamard_gradient
    ~transforms.expand_multipar
    ~transforms.expand_trainable_multipar
    ~transforms.expand_nonunitary_gen

Transforms developer functions
------------------------------

:class:`~.TransformContainer`, :class:`~.TransformDispatcher` and  :class:`~.TransformProgram` are
developer-facing objects that allow the
creation, dispatching and composability of transforms. If you would like to make a custom transform, refer
instead to the documentation of :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~transforms.core.transform_dispatcher
    ~transforms.core.transform_program

Old transforms framework
------------------------

These utility functions were previously used to create transforms in PennyLane and are now
deprecated. It is now recommended to use :class:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`
for the creation of custom transforms.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~single_tape_transform
    ~batch_transform
    ~qfunc_transform
    ~op_transform

Transforming circuits
---------------------

A quantum transform is a crucial concept in PennyLane, and refers to mapping a quantum
circuit to one or more circuits, alongside a classical post-processing function.
Once a transform is registered with PennyLane, the transformed circuits will be executed,
and the classical post-processing function automatically applied to the outputs.
This becomes particularly valuable when a transform generates multiple circuits,
requiring a method to aggregate or reduce the results (e.g.,
applying the parameter-shift rule or computing the expectation value of a Hamiltonian
term-by-term).

.. note::

    For examples of built-in transforms that come with PennyLane, see the
    :doc:`/introduction/compiling_circuits` documentation.

Creating your own transform
---------------------------

To streamline the creation of transforms and ensure their versatility across
various circuit abstractions in PennyLane, the
:func:`pennylane.transform` is available.

This decorator registers transforms that accept a :class:`~.QuantumTape`
as its primary input, and returns a sequence of :class:`~.QuantumTape`
and an associated processing function.

To illustrate the process of creating a quantum transform, let's consider a straightforward example. Suppose we want
a transform that removes all :class:`~.RX` operations from a given circuit. In this case, we merely need to filter the
original :class:`~.QuantumTape` and return a new one without the filtered operations. As we don't require a specific processing
function in this scenario, we include a function that simply returns the first and only result.

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Sequence, Callable
    from pennylane.tape import QuantumTape

    def remove_rx(tape: QuantumTape) -> (Sequence[QuantumTape], Callable):

        operations = filter(lambda op: op.name != "RX", tape.operations)
        new_tape = type(tape)(operations, tape.measurements, shots=tape.shots)

        def postprocessing(results):
            return results[0]

        return [new_tape], postprocessing

To make your transform applicable to both :class:`~.QNode` and quantum functions, you can use the :func:`pennylane.transform` decorator.

.. code-block:: python

    dispatched_transform = qml.transform(remove_rx)

For a more advanced example, let's consider a transform that sums a circuit with its adjoint. We define the adjoint
of the tape operations, create a new tape, and return both tapes. The processing function then sums the results.

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Sequence, Callable
    from pennylane.tape import QuantumTape

    @qml.transform
    def sum_circuit_and_adjoint(tape: QuantumTape) -> (Sequence[QuantumTape], Callable):

        operations = [qml.adjoint(op) for op in tape.operation]
        new_tape = type(tape)(operations, tape.measurements, shots=tape.shots)

        def null_postprocessing(results):
            return qml.sum(results)

        return [tape, shifted_tape], null_postprocessing

Composability of transforms
---------------------------

Transforms are inherently composable on a :class:`~.QNode`, meaning that transforms with compatible post-processing
functions can be successively applied to QNodes. For example, this allows for the application of multiple compilation
passes on a QNode to maximize gate reduction before execution.

.. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=1)
        @qml.transforms.merge_rotations
        @qml.transforms.cancel_inverses
        @qml.qnode(device=dev):
        def circuit(x, y):
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.RX(x, wires=0)
            qml.RY(y, wires=0)
            qml.RZ(y, wires=0)
            qml.RY(x, wires=0)
            return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))

In this example, inverses are canceled, leading to the removal of two Hadamard gates. Subsequently, rotations are
merged into a single :class:`qml.Rot` gate. Consequently, two transforms are successfully applied to the circuit.
