This subpackage contains QNode, quantum function, device, and tape transforms.


.. currentmodule:: pennylane

QNode transforms
----------------

The following transforms act on QNodes. They return new transformed functions
that compute the desired quantity.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~transforms.classical_jacobian
    ~draw
    ~metric_tensor

Quantum function transforms
---------------------------

The following transforms act on quantum functions (Python functions
containing quantum operations) that are used *inside* QNodes.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~adjoint
    ~ctrl
    ~transforms.invisible

Tape transforms
---------------

The following transforms act on quantum tapes, and return one or
more tapes as well as a classical processing function.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~transforms.measurement_grouping
    ~transforms.metric_tensor_tape
