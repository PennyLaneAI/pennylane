This subpackage contains PennyLane transforms and their building blocks.

.. currentmodule:: pennylane

Custom transforms
-----------------

:func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>` can be used to define custom transformations
that work with PennyLane QNodes; such transformations can map a circuit
to one or many new circuits alongside associated classical post-processing.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~transforms.core.transform

Transforms library
------------------
A range of ready-to-use transforms are available in PennyLane.

Transforms for circuit compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of transforms to perform basic circuit compilation tasks.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~compile
    ~transforms.cancel_inverses
    ~transforms.commute_controlled
    ~transforms.merge_rotations
    ~transforms.single_qubit_fusion
    ~transforms.unitary_to_rot
    ~transforms.merge_amplitude_embedding
    ~transforms.remove_barrier
    ~transforms.undo_swaps
    ~transforms.pattern_matching_optimization
    ~transforms.transpile

There are also utility functions and decompositions available that assist with
both transforms, and decompositions within the larger PennyLane codebase.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~transforms.one_qubit_decomposition
    ~transforms.two_qubit_decomposition
    ~transforms.set_decomposition
    ~transforms.pattern_matching
    ~transforms.to_zx
    ~transforms.from_zx

There are also utility functions that take a circuit and return a DAG.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~transforms.commutation_dag
    ~transforms.CommutationDAG
    ~transforms.CommutationDAGNode

Transform for Clifford+T compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following functions assist in decomposing operations to the Clifford+T basis.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~transforms.sk_decomposition

Transforms for error mitigation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~transforms.mitigate_with_zne
    ~transforms.fold_global
    ~transforms.poly_extrapolate
    ~transforms.richardson_extrapolate

Other transforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These transforms use the :func:`pennylane.transform` function / decorator and can be used on
:class:`pennylane.tape.QuantumTape`, :class:`pennylane.QNode`. They fulfill multiple purposes like circuit
preprocessing, get information from a circuit and more.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~metric_tensor
    ~adjoint_metric_tensor
    ~batch_params
    ~batch_input
    ~transforms.insert
    ~defer_measurements
    ~transforms.split_non_commuting
    ~transforms.broadcast_expand
    ~transforms.hamiltonian_expand
    ~transforms.sign_expand
    ~transforms.sum_expand
    ~transforms.convert_to_numpy_parameters
    ~apply_controlled_Q
    ~quantum_monte_carlo

Transforms that act only on QNodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These transforms only accept QNodes, and return new transformed functions
that compute the desired quantity.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~transforms.classical_jacobian
    ~batch_partial
    ~specs
    ~draw
    ~draw_mpl

Decorators and utility functions
--------------------------------

The following decorators and convenience functions are provided
to help build custom QNode, quantum function, and tape transforms:

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~transforms.make_tape
    ~transforms.map_batch_transform
    ~transforms.create_expand_fn
    ~transforms.create_decomp_expand_fn
    ~transforms.expand_invalid_trainable
    ~transforms.expand_invalid_trainable_hadamard_gradient
    ~transforms.expand_multipar
    ~transforms.expand_trainable_multipar
    ~transforms.expand_nonunitary_gen

Transforms developer functions
------------------------------

:class:`~.TransformContainer`, :class:`~.TransformDispatcher` and  :class:`~.TransformProgram` are
developer-facing objects that allow the
creation, dispatching and composability of transforms. If you would like to make a custom transform, refer
instead to the documentation of :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~transforms.core.transform_dispatcher
    ~transforms.core.transform_program

Old transforms framework
------------------------

These utility functions were previously used to create transforms in PennyLane and are now
deprecated. It is now recommended to use :class:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`
for the creation of custom transforms.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api

    ~single_tape_transform
    ~batch_transform
    ~qfunc_transform
    ~op_transform
