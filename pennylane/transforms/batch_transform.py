    Args:
        transform (Callable): the transform to be mapped
        tapes (Sequence[QuantumTape]): The sequence of tapes the
            transform should be applied to. Each tape in the sequence
            is transformed by the transform.

    **Example**

    Consider the following tapes:

    .. code-block:: python

        H = qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(1) - qml.X(0)


        ops1 = [
            qml.RX(0.5, wires=0),
            qml.RY(0.1, wires=1),
            qml.CNOT(wires=(0,1))
        ]
        measurements1 = [qml.expval(H)]
        tape1 = qml.tape.QuantumTape(ops1, measurements1)

        ops2 = [qml.Hadamard(0), qml.CRX(0.5, wires=(0,1)), qml.CNOT((0,1))]
        measurements2 = [qml.expval(H + 0.5 * qml.Y(0))]
        tape2 = qml.tape.QuantumTape(ops2, measurements2)


    We can use ``map_batch_transform`` to map a single
    transform across both of the these tapes in such a way
    that allows us to submit a single job for execution:

    >>> tapes, fn = map_batch_transform(qml.transforms.hamiltonian_expand, [tape1, tape2])
    >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)
    >>> fn(qml.execute(tapes, dev, qml.gradients.param_shift))
