    This method first decomposes the gate operations to a basis comprised of Clifford, :class:`~.RZ` and
    :class:`~.GlobalPhase` operations (and their adjoint). The Clifford gates include the following PennyLane operations:

    - Single qubit gates - :class:`~.Identity`, :class:`~.PauliX`, :class:`~.PauliY`, :class:`~.PauliZ`,
      :class:`~.SX`, :class:`~.S`, and :class:`~.Hadamard`.
    - Two qubit gates - :class:`~.CNOT`, :class:`~.CY`, :class:`~.CZ`, :class:`~.SWAP`, and :class:`~.ISWAP`.

    Then the leftover single qubit :class:`~.pennylane.RZ` operations are approximated in the Clifford+T basis with
    :math:`\epsilon > 0` error using the recursive Solovay-Kitaev algorithm described in
    `Dawson and Nielsen (2005) <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0505030>`_.

        qfunc (function): A quantum function
        max_depth (int): The depth to use for tape expansion before manual decomposition to Clifford+T basis is applied
        method (str): Method to be used for Clifford+T decomposition. Default value is ``"sk"`` for Solovay-Kitaev
        **kwargs: Keyword argument to pass options for the ``method`` used for decompositions

            * **depth** (int), **basis_set** (list(str)), **basis_length** (int):
              arguments for using the ``"sk"`` method, i.e., for performing Solovay-Kitaev decomposition using :func:`~.sk_decomposition`

    Returns:

        it returns a QNode with the transform added to its transform program.
        If a tape is passed, returns a tuple containing a list of
        quantum tapes to be evaluated, and a function to be applied to these
        tape executions.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If any gate operation does not have a rule for its decomposition
        NotImplementedError: If chosen decomposition is not supported
