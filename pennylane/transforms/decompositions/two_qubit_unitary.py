# Developer notes:
#
# I was not able to get this transform to be fully differentiable for unitary
# matrices that were constructed within a QNode, based on the QNode's input
# arguments. I would argue this is a fairly limited use case, but it would still
# be nice to have this eventually. Each interface fails for different reasons.
#
# - In Autograd, we obtain the AttributeError
#       'ArrayBox' object has no attribute 'conjugate'
#   for the 0-CNOT case when the zyz_decomposition function is called. In the
#   other cases, it cannot autodifferentiate through the linalg.eigvals function.
# - In Torch, it is not currently possible to autodiff through linalg.det for
#   complex values.
# - In Tensorflow, it sometimes works in limited cases (0, sometimes 1 CNOT), but
#   for others it fails without output making it hard to pinpoint the cause.
# - In JAX, we receive the TypeError:
#       Can't differentiate w.r.t. type <class 'jaxlib.xla_extension.Array'>

def two_qubit_decomposition(U, wires):
    r"""Decompose a two-qubit unitary :math:`U` in terms of elementary operations.

    It is known that an arbitrary two-qubit operation can be implemented using a
    maximum of 3 CNOTs. This transform first determines the required number of
    CNOTs, then decomposes the operator into a circuit with a fixed form.  These
    decompositions are based a number of works by Shende, Markov, and Bullock
    `(1) <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308033>`__, `(2)
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308045v3>`__, `(3)
    <https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~imarkov/pubs/conf/spie04-2qubits.pdf>`__,
    though we note that many alternative decompositions are possible.

    For the 3-CNOT case, we recover the following circuit, which is Figure 2 in
    reference (1) above:

    .. figure:: ../../_static/two_qubit_decomposition_3_cnots.svg
        :align: center
        :width: 70%
        :target: javascript:void(0);

    where :math:`A, B, C, D` are :math:`SU(2)` operations, and the rotation angles are
    computed based on features of the input unitary :math:`U`.

    For the 2-CNOT case, the decomposition is

    .. figure:: ../../_static/two_qubit_decomposition_2_cnots.svg
        :align: center
        :width: 50%
        :target: javascript:void(0);

    For 1 CNOT, we have a CNOT surrounded by one :math:`SU(2)` per wire on each
    side.  The special case of no CNOTs simply returns a tensor product of two
    :math:`SU(2)` operations.

    This decomposition can be applied automatically to all two-qubit
    :class:`~.QubitUnitary` operations using the
    :func:`~pennylane.transforms.unitary_to_rot` transform.

    .. warning::

        This decomposition will not be differentiable in the ``unitary_to_rot``
        transform if the matrix being decomposed depends on parameters with
        respect to which we would like to take the gradient.  See the
        documentation of :func:`~pennylane.transforms.unitary_to_rot` for
        explicit examples of the differentiable and non-differentiable cases.

    Args:
        U (tensor): A :math:`4 \times 4` unitary matrix.
        wires (Union[Wires, Sequence[int] or int]): The wires on which to apply the operation.

    Returns:
        list[Operation]: A list of operations that represent the decomposition
        of the matrix U.

    **Example**

    Suppose we create a random element of :math:`U(4)`, and would like to decompose it
    into elementary gates in our circuit.

    >>> from scipy.stats import unitary_group
    >>> U = unitary_group.rvs(4)
    >>> U
    array([[-0.29113625+0.56393527j,  0.39546712-0.14193837j,
             0.04637428+0.01311566j, -0.62006741+0.18403743j],
           [-0.45479211+0.25978444j, -0.52737418-0.5549423j ,
            -0.23429057+0.10728103j,  0.16061807-0.21769762j],
           [-0.4501231 +0.04065613j, -0.25558662+0.38209554j,
            -0.04143479-0.56598134j,  0.12983673+0.49548507j],
           [ 0.23899902+0.24800931j,  0.03374589-0.15784319j,
