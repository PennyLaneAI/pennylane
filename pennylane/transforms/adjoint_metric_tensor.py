    r"""Implements the adjoint method outlined in
    `Jones <https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02991>`__ to compute the metric tensor.

    A forward pass followed by intermediate partial backwards passes are
    used to evaluate the metric tensor in :math:`\mathcal{O}(p^2)` operations,
    where :math:`p` is the number of trainable operations, using 4 state
    vectors.

    .. note::
        The adjoint metric tensor method has the following restrictions:

        * Currently only ``"default.qubit"`` with ``shots=None`` is supported.

        * We assume the circuit to be composed of unitary gates only and rely
          on the ``generator`` property of the gates to be implemented.
          Note also that this makes the metric tensor strictly real-valued.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumTape): Circuit to compute the metric tensor of

    Returns:
        qnode (QNode) or tuple[List[QuantumTape], function]:

        The transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`. Executing this circuit
        will provide the metric tensor in the form of a tensor. Dimensions are ``(tape.num_params, tape.num_params)``.

    .. seealso:: :func:`~.metric_tensor` for hardware-compatible metric tensor computations.

    **Example**

    Consider the following QNode:

    .. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)

        @qml.qnode(dev, interface="autograd")
        def circuit(weights):
            qml.RX(weights[0], wires=0)
            qml.RY(weights[1], wires=0)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            qml.RZ(weights[2], wires=1)
            qml.RZ(weights[3], wires=0)
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1)), qml.expval(qml.PauliY(1))

    We can use the ``adjoint_metric_tensor`` transform to generate a new function
    that returns the metric tensor of this QNode:

    >>> mt_fn = qml.adjoint_metric_tensor(circuit)
    >>> weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5], requires_grad=True)
    >>> mt_fn(weights)
    tensor([[ 0.25  ,  0.    , -0.0497, -0.0497],
            [ 0.    ,  0.2475,  0.0243,  0.0243],
            [-0.0497,  0.0243,  0.0123,  0.0123],
            [-0.0497,  0.0243,  0.0123,  0.0123]], requires_grad=True)

    This approach has the benefit of being significantly faster than the hardware-ready
    ``metric_tensor`` function:

    >>> import time
    >>> start_time = time.process_time()
    >>> mt = mt_fn(weights)
    >>> time.process_time() - start_time
    0.019
    >>> mt_fn_2 = qml.metric_tensor(circuit)
    >>> start_time = time.process_time()
    >>> mt = mt_fn_2(weights)
    >>> time.process_time() - start_time
    0.025

    This speedup becomes more drastic for larger circuits.
    The drawback of the adjoint method is that it is only available on simulators and without
    shot simulations.
