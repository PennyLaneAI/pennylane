def hamiltonian_expand(tape: QuantumTape, group: bool = True) -> (Sequence[QuantumTape], Callable):
    r"""
    Splits a tape measuring a Hamiltonian expectation into mutliple tapes of Pauli expectations,
    and provides a function to recombine the results.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumTape or Callable): the quantum circuit used when calculating the
            expectation value of the Hamiltonian
        group (bool): Whether to compute disjoint groups of commuting Pauli observables, leading to fewer tapes.
            If grouping information can be found in the Hamiltonian, it will be used even if group=False.

    Returns:
        qnode (QNode) or tuple[List[QuantumTape], function]: The transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.

    **Example**

    Given a Hamiltonian,

    .. code-block:: python3

        H = qml.PauliY(2) @ qml.PauliZ(1) + 0.5 * qml.PauliZ(2) + qml.PauliZ(1)

    and a tape of the form,

    .. code-block:: python3

        ops = [qml.Hadamard(0), qml.CNOT((0,1)), qml.PauliX(2)]
        tape = qml.tape.QuantumTape(ops, [qml.expval(H)])

    We can use the ``hamiltonian_expand`` transform to generate new tapes and a classical
    post-processing function for computing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian.

    >>> tapes, fn = qml.transforms.hamiltonian_expand(tape)

    We can evaluate these tapes on a device:

    >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)
    >>> res = dev.execute(tapes)

    Applying the processing function results in the expectation value of the Hamiltonian:

    >>> fn(res)
    array(-0.5)

    Fewer tapes can be constructed by grouping commuting observables. This can be achieved
    by the ``group`` keyword argument:

    .. code-block:: python3

        H = qml.Hamiltonian([1., 2., 3.], [qml.PauliZ(0), qml.PauliX(1), qml.PauliX(0)])

        tape = qml.tape.QuantumTape(ops, [qml.expval(H)])

    With grouping, the Hamiltonian gets split into two groups of observables (here ``[qml.PauliZ(0)]`` and
    ``[qml.PauliX(1), qml.PauliX(0)]``):

    >>> tapes, fn = qml.transforms.hamiltonian_expand(tape)
    >>> len(tapes)
    2

    Without grouping it gets split into three groups (``[qml.PauliZ(0)]``, ``[qml.PauliX(1)]`` and ``[qml.PauliX(0)]``):

    >>> tapes, fn = qml.transforms.hamiltonian_expand(tape, group=False)
    >>> len(tapes)
    3

    Alternatively, if the Hamiltonian has already computed groups, they are used even if ``group=False``:

    .. code-block:: python3

        obs = [qml.PauliZ(0), qml.PauliX(1), qml.PauliX(0)]
        coeffs = [1., 2., 3.]
        H = qml.Hamiltonian(coeffs, obs, grouping_type='qwc')

        # the initialisation already computes grouping information and stores it in the Hamiltonian
        assert H.grouping_indices is not None

        tape = qml.tape.QuantumTape(ops, [qml.expval(H)])

    Grouping information has been used to reduce the number of tapes from 3 to 2:

    >>> tapes, fn = qml.transforms.hamiltonian_expand(tape, group=False)
    >>> len(tapes)
    2

        quantum tapes to be evaluated, and a function to be applied to these

    **Example**

    Given a Sum operator,

    .. code-block:: python3

        S = qml.sum(qml.prod(qml.PauliY(2), qml.PauliZ(1)), qml.s_prod(0.5, qml.PauliZ(2)), qml.PauliZ(1))

    and a tape of the form,

        measurements = [
            qml.expval(S),
            qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0)),
            qml.expval(qml.PauliX(1)),
            qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(2))
        ]
        tape = qml.tape.QuantumTape(ops, measurements)

    We can use the ``sum_expand`` transform to generate new tapes and a classical
    post-processing function to speed-up the computation of the expectation value of the `Sum`.

    >>> tapes, fn = qml.transforms.sum_expand(tape, group=False)
    >>> for tape in tapes:
    ...     print(tape.measurements)
    [expval(PauliY(wires=[2]) @ PauliZ(wires=[1]))]
    [expval(PauliZ(wires=[2]))]
    [expval(PauliZ(wires=[1]))]
    [expval(PauliZ(wires=[0]))]
    [expval(PauliX(wires=[1]))]

    Five tapes are generated: the first three contain the summands of the `Sum` operator,
    and the last two contain the remaining observables. Note that the scalars of the scalar products
    have been removed. In the processing function, these values will be multiplied by the result obtained
    from executing the tapes.

    Additionally, the observable expval(PauliZ(wires=[2])) occurs twice in the original tape, but only once
    in the transformed tapes. When there are multipe identical measurements in the circuit, the measurement
    is performed once and the outcome is copied when obtaining the final result. This will also be resolved
    when the processing function is applied.

    We can evaluate these tapes on a device:

    >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)
    >>> res = dev.execute(tapes)

    Applying the processing function results in the expectation value of the Hamiltonian:

    >>> fn(res)
    [-0.5, 0.0, 0.0, -0.9999999999999996]

    Fewer tapes can be constructed by grouping observables acting on different wires. This can be achieved
    by the ``group`` keyword argument:

    .. code-block:: python3

        S = qml.sum(qml.PauliZ(0), qml.s_prod(2, qml.PauliX(1)), qml.s_prod(3, qml.PauliX(0)))

        ops = [qml.Hadamard(0), qml.CNOT((0,1)), qml.PauliX(2)]
        tape = qml.tape.QuantumTape(ops, [qml.expval(S)])

    With grouping, the Sum gets split into two groups of observables (here
    ``[qml.PauliZ(0), qml.s_prod(2, qml.PauliX(1))]`` and ``[qml.s_prod(3, qml.PauliX(0))]``):

    >>> tapes, fn = qml.transforms.sum_expand(tape, group=True)
    >>> for tape in tapes:
