    Implementation of ideas from arXiv:2207.09479

    For the calculation of variances, one assumes an even distribution of shots among the groups.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumTape): the quantum circuit used when calculating the expectation value of the Hamiltonian

          processing approximation of the sgn-decomposition
        delta (float): The minimal
        controls (List[control1, control2]): The two additional controls to implement the
          Hadamard test and the quantum signal processing part on, have to be wires on the device

    Returns:
        qnode (pennylane.QNode) or tuple[List[.QuantumTape], function]: The transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.

    **Example**

    Given a Hamiltonian,

    .. code-block:: python3

        H = qml.PauliZ(0) + 0.5 * qml.PauliZ(2) + qml.PauliZ(1)

    a device with auxiliary qubits,

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=[0,1,2,'Hadamard','Target'])

    and a circuit of the form, with the transform as decorator.

    .. code-block:: python3

        @qml.transforms.sign_expand
        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit():
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            qml.PauliX(wires=2)
            return qml.expval(H)

    >>> circuit()
    -0.4999999999999999

    You can also work directly on tapes:

    .. code-block:: python3

            operations = [qml.Hadamard(wires=0), qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1]), qml.PauliX(wires=2)]
            measurements = [qml.expval(H)]
            tape = qml.tape.QuantumTape(operations, measurements)

    We can use the ``sign_expand`` transform to generate new tapes and a classical
    post-processing function for computing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in these new decompositions

    >>> tapes, fn = qml.transforms.sign_expand(tape)

    We can evaluate these tapes on a device, it needs two additional ancilla gates labeled 'Hadamard' and 'Target' if
    one wants to make the circuit approximation of the decomposition:

    >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=[0,1,2,'Hadamard','Target'])
    >>> res = dev.execute(tapes)
    >>> fn(res)
    -0.4999999999999999

    To evaluate the circuit approximation of the decomposition one can construct the sgn-decomposition by changing the
    kwarg circuit to True:

    >>> tapes, fn = qml.transforms.sign_expand(tape, circuit=True, J=20, delta=0)
    >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=[0,1,2,'Hadamard','Target'])
    >>> dev.execute(tapes)
    >>> fn(res)
    -0.24999999999999994


    Lastly, as the paper is about minimizing variance, one can also calculate the variance of the estimator by
    changing the tape:


    .. code-block:: python3

            operations = [qml.Hadamard(wires=0), qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1]), qml.PauliX(wires=2)]
            measurements = [qml.var(H)]
            tape = qml.tape.QuantumTape(operations, measurements)

    >>> tapes, fn = qml.transforms.sign_expand(tape, circuit=True, J=20, delta=0)
    >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=[0,1,2,'Hadamard','Target'])
    >>> res = dev.execute(tapes)
    >>> fn(res)
