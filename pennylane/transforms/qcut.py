    Converts a quantum tape to a directed multigraph.

        tape (QuantumTape): tape to be converted into a directed multigraph

        graph (MultiDiGraph): a directed multigraph that captures the circuit
        structure of the input tape

    **Example**

    Consider the following tape:

            qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(1))
