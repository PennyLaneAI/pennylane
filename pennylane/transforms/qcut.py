    .. note::

        This function is designed for use as part of the circuit cutting workflow. Check out the
        :doc:`transforms </code/qml_transforms>` page for more details.

    Consider the three tensors :math:`T^{(1)}`, :math:`T^{(2)}`, and :math:`T^{(3)}`, along with
    their contraction equation

    .. math::

        \sum_{ijklmn} T^{(1)}_{ij,km} T^{(2)}_{kl,in} T^{(3)}_{mn,jl}

    Each tensor is the result of the tomography of a circuit fragment and has some indices
    corresponding to state preparations (marked by the indices before the comma) and some indices
    corresponding to measurements (marked by the indices after the comma).

    An equivalent representation of the contraction equation is to use a directed multigraph known
    as the communication/quotient graph. In the communication graph, each tensor is assigned a node
    and edges are added between nodes to mark a contraction along an index. The communication graph
    resulting from the above contraction equation is a complete directed graph.

    In the communication graph provided by :func:`fragment_graph`, edges are composed of
    :class:`PrepareNode` and :class:`MeasureNode` pairs. To correctly map back to the contraction
    equation, we must keep track of the order of preparation and measurement indices in each tensor.
    This order is specified in the ``prepare_nodes`` and ``measure_nodes`` arguments.

    Args:
        tensors (Sequence): the tensors to be contracted
        communication_graph (MultiDiGraph): the communication graph determining connectivity between
            the tensors
        prepare_nodes (Sequence[Sequence[PrepareNode]]): a sequence of size
            ``len(communication_graph.nodes)`` that determines the order of preparation indices in
            each tensor
        measure_nodes (Sequence[Sequence[MeasureNode]]): a sequence of size
            ``len(communication_graph.nodes)`` that determines the order of measurement indices in
            each tensor
        use_opt_einsum (bool): Determines whether to use the
            `opt_einsum <https://dgasmith.github.io/opt_einsum/>`__ package. This package is useful
            for tensor contractions of large networks but must be installed separately using, e.g.,
            ``pip install opt_einsum``. Both settings for ``use_opt_einsum`` result in a
            differentiable contraction.

    Returns:
        float or array-like: the result of contracting the tensor network

    **Example**

    We first set up the tensors and their corresponding :class:`~.PrepareNode` and
    :class:`~.MeasureNode` orderings:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pennylane.transforms import qcut

        prep = [[], [qcut.PrepareNode(wires=0)]]
        meas = [[qcut.MeasureNode(wires=0)], []]

    The communication graph describing edges in the tensor network must also be constructed:

    .. code-block:: python

        graph = nx.MultiDiGraph([(0, 1, {"pair": (meas[0][0], prep[1][0])})])

    The network can then be contracted using:
