        :title: Usage Details

        Consider an input quantum circuit ``fn`` that performs the unitary

        .. math::

            \mathcal{F} = \mathcal{R} \mathcal{A}.

        .. figure:: ../../_static/ops/f.svg
            :align: center
            :width: 15%
            :target: javascript:void(0);

        Here, the unitary :math:`\mathcal{A}` prepares a probability distribution :math:`p(i)` of
        dimension :math:`M = 2^{m}` over :math:`m \geq 1` qubits:

        .. math::

            \mathcal{A}|0\rangle^{\otimes m} = \sum_{i \in X} p(i) |i\rangle,

        where :math:`X = \{0, 1, \ldots, M - 1\}` and :math:`|i\rangle` is the basis state
        corresponding to :math:`i`. The :math:`\mathcal{R}` unitary imprints the
        result of a function :math:`f: X \rightarrow [0, 1]` onto an ancilla qubit:

        .. math::

            \mathcal{R}|i\rangle |0\rangle = |i\rangle \left(\sqrt{1 - f(i)} |0\rangle + \sqrt{f(i)}|1\rangle\right).

        Following `this <https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00109>`__ paper,
        the probability of measuring the state :math:`|1\rangle` in the final
        qubit is

        .. math::

            \mu = \sum_{i \in X} p(i) f(i).

        However, it is possible to measure :math:`\mu` more efficiently using quantum Monte Carlo
        estimation. This function transforms an input quantum circuit ``fn`` that performs the
        unitary :math:`\mathcal{F}` to a larger circuit for measuring :math:`\mu` using the quantum
        Monte Carlo algorithm.

        .. figure:: ../../_static/ops/qmc.svg
            :align: center
            :width: 60%
            :target: javascript:void(0);

        The algorithm proceeds as follows:

        #. The probability distribution :math:`p(i)` is encoded using a unitary :math:`\mathcal{A}`
           applied to the first :math:`m` qubits specified by ``wires``.
        #. The function :math:`f(i)` is encoded onto the ``target_wire`` using a unitary
           :math:`\mathcal{R}`.
        #. The unitary :math:`\mathcal{Q}` is defined with eigenvalues
           :math:`e^{\pm 2 \pi i \theta}` such that the phase :math:`\theta` encodes the expectation
           value through the equation :math:`\mu = (1 + \cos (\pi \theta)) / 2`. The circuit in
           steps 1 and 2 prepares an equal superposition over the two states corresponding to the
           eigenvalues :math:`e^{\pm 2 \pi i \theta}`.
        #. The circuit returned by this function is applied so that :math:`\pm\theta` can be
           estimated by finding the probabilities of the :math:`n` estimation wires. This in turn
           allows for the estimation of :math:`\mu`.

        Visit `Rebentrost et al. (2018)
        <https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00109>`__ for further details.
        In this algorithm, the number of applications :math:`N` of the :math:`\mathcal{Q}` unitary
        scales as :math:`2^{n}`. However, due to the use of quantum phase estimation, the error
        :math:`\epsilon` scales as :math:`\mathcal{O}(2^{-n})`. Hence,

        .. math::

            N = \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right).

        This scaling can be compared to standard Monte Carlo estimation, where :math:`N` samples are
        generated from the probability distribution and the average over :math:`f` is taken. In that
        case,

        .. math::

            N =  \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}\right).

        Hence, the quantum Monte Carlo algorithm has a quadratically improved time complexity with
        :math:`N`.

        **Example**

        Consider a standard normal distribution :math:`p(x)` and a function
        :math:`f(x) = \sin ^{2} (x)`. The expectation value of :math:`f(x)` is
        :math:`\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)p(x)dx \approx 0.432332`. This number can be approximated by
        discretizing the problem and using the quantum Monte Carlo algorithm.

        First, the problem is discretized:

        .. code-block:: python

            from scipy.stats import norm

            m = 5
            M = 2 ** m

            xmax = np.pi  # bound to region [-pi, pi]
            xs = np.linspace(-xmax, xmax, M)

            probs = np.array([norm().pdf(x) for x in xs])
            probs /= np.sum(probs)

            func = lambda i: np.sin(xs[i]) ** 2
            r_rotations = np.array([2 * np.arcsin(np.sqrt(func(i))) for i in range(M)])

        The ``quantum_monte_carlo`` transform can then be used:

        .. code-block::

            from pennylane.templates.state_preparations.mottonen import (
                _apply_uniform_rotation_dagger as r_unitary,
            )

            n = 6
            N = 2 ** n

            a_wires = range(m)
            wires = range(m + 1)
            target_wire = m
            estimation_wires = range(m + 1, n + m + 1)

            dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=(n + m + 1))

            def fn():
                qml.templates.MottonenStatePreparation(np.sqrt(probs), wires=a_wires)
                r_unitary(qml.RY, r_rotations, control_wires=a_wires[::-1], target_wire=target_wire)

            @qml.qnode(dev)
            def qmc():
                qml.quantum_monte_carlo(fn, wires, target_wire, estimation_wires)()
                return qml.probs(estimation_wires)

            phase_estimated = np.argmax(qmc()[:int(N / 2)]) / N

        The estimated value can be retrieved using the formula :math:`\mu = (1-\cos(\pi \theta))/2`

        >>> (1 - np.cos(np.pi * phase_estimated)) / 2
        0.42663476277231915
