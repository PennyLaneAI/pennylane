    The multi-qubit gate :math:`Z = I - 2|0\rangle \langle 0|` can be performed using the
    conventional multi-controlled-Z gate with an additional bit flip on each qubit before and after.

    This function performs the multi-controlled-Z gate via a multi-controlled-X gate by picking an
    arbitrary target wire to perform the X and adding a Hadamard on that wire either side of the
    transformation.

    Additional control from ``control_wire`` is then included within the multi-controlled-X gate.

    Args:
        wires (Wires): the wires on which the Z gate is applied
        control_wire (Wires): the control wire from the register of phase estimation qubits
        work_wires (Wires): the work wires used in the decomposition

    defined in `this <https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.98.022321>`__ paper.

    Given a callable ``fn`` input corresponding to the :math:`\mathcal{F}` unitary in the above
    paper, this function transforms the circuit into a controlled-version of the :math:`\mathcal{Q}`
    unitary which forms part of the quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. In this algorithm, one of the
    wires acted upon by :math:`\mathcal{F}`, specified by ``target_wire``, is used to embed a
    Monte Carlo estimation problem. The :math:`\mathcal{Q}` unitary is then designed to encode the
    target expectation value as a phase in one of its eigenvalues.

    This function transforms to a controlled version of :math:`\mathcal{Q}` that is compatible with
    quantum phase estimation (see :class:`~.QuantumPhaseEstimation` for more details).

    Args:
        fn (Callable): a quantum function that applies quantum operations according to the
            :math:`\mathcal{F}` unitary used as part of quantum Monte Carlo estimation
        wires (Union[Wires or Sequence[int]]): the wires acted upon by the ``fn`` circuit
