def norm(one, two, eigvals):
    r"""Return the 1-norm of a molecular Hamiltonian from the one- and two-electron integrals and
    eigenvalues of the factorized two-electron integral tensor.

    The 1-norm of a double-factorized molecular Hamiltonian is computed as
    [`arXiv:2007.14460 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14460>`_]

    .. math::

        \lambda = ||T|| + \frac{1}{4} \sum_r ||L^{(r)}||^2,

    where the Schatten 1-norm for a given matrix :math:`T` is defined as

    .. math::

        ||T|| = \sum_k |\text{eigvals}[T]_k|.

    The matrices :math:`L^{(r)}` are obtained from factorization of the two-electron integral
    tensor :math:`V` such that

    .. math::

        V_{ijkl} = \sum_r L_{ij}^{(r)} L_{kl}^{(r) T}.

    The matrix :math:`T` is constructed from the one- and two-electron integrals as

    .. math::

        T = h_{ij} - \frac{1}{2} \sum_l V_{illj} + \sum_l V_{llij}.

    Note that the two-electron integral tensor must be arranged in chemist notation.

    Args:
        one (array[array[float]]): one-electron integrals
        two (array[array[float]]): two-electron integrals
        eigvals (array[float]): eigenvalues of the matrices obtained from factorizing the
            two-electron integral tensor

    Returns:
        array[float]: 1-norm of the Hamiltonian

    **Example**

    >>> symbols  = ['H', 'H', 'O']
    >>> geometry = np.array([[0.00000000,  0.00000000,  0.28377432],
    >>>                      [0.00000000,  1.45278171, -1.00662237],
    >>>                      [0.00000000, -1.45278171, -1.00662237]], requires_grad=False)
    >>> mol = qml.qchem.Molecule(symbols, geometry, basis_name='sto-3g')
    >>> core, one, two = qml.qchem.electron_integrals(mol)()
    >>> two = np.swapaxes(two, 1, 3) # convert to the chemists notation
    >>> _, eigvals, _ = factorize(two, 1e-5)
    >>> print(norm(one, two, eigvals))
