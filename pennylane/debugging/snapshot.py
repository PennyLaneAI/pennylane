def snapshots(tape: QuantumTape) -> tuple[Sequence[QuantumTape], Callable[[ResultBatch], Result]]:
    r"""This transform processes :class:`~pennylane.Snapshot` instances contained in a circuit,
    depending on the compatibility of the execution device.
    For supported devices, the snapshots' measurements are computed as the execution progresses.
    Otherwise, the :func:`QuantumTape <pennylane.tape.QuantumTape>` gets split into several, one for each snapshot, with each aggregating
    all the operations up to that specific snapshot.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumTape or Callable): a quantum circuit.

    Returns:
        dictionary (dict) or qnode (QNode) or quantum function (Callable) or tuple[List[QuantumTape], function]:
        The transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.

    If tape splitting is carried out, the transform will be conservative about the wires that it includes in each tape.
    So, if all operations preceding a snapshot in a 3-qubit circuit has been applied to only one wire,
    the tape would only be looking at this wire. This can be overriden by the configuration of the execution device
    and its nature.

    Regardless of the transform's behaviour, the output is a dictionary where each key is either
    the tag supplied to the snapshot or its index in order of appearance, in addition to an
    ``"execution_results"`` entry that returns the final output of the quantum circuit. The post-processing
    function is responsible for aggregating the results into this dictionary.

    When the transform is applied to a QNode, the ``shots`` configuration is inherited from the device.
    Therefore, the snapshot measurements must be supported by the device's nature. An exception of this are
    the :func:`qml.state <pennylane.state>` measurements on finite-shot simulators.

    .. warning::

        For devices that do not support snapshots (e.g QPUs, external plug-in simulators), be mindful of
        additional costs that you might incur due to the 1 separate execution/snapshot behaviour.

    **Example**

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

        @qml.qnode(dev, interface=None)
        def circuit():
            qml.Snapshot(measurement=qml.expval(qml.Z(0)))
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            qml.Snapshot()
            return qml.expval(qml.X(0))

    >>> qml.snapshots(circuit)()
    {0: 1.0,
    1: array([0.70710678+0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.70710678+0.j]),
    'execution_results': 0.0}

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", shots=200, wires=2)

        @qml.snapshots
        @qml.qnode(dev, interface=None)
        def circuit():
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            qml.Snapshot()
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            return qml.counts()

    >>> circuit()
    {0: array([0.70710678+0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.70710678+0.j, 0.        +0.j]),
    'execution_results': {'00': 101, '11': 99}}

    Here one can see how a device that does not natively support snapshots executes two different circuits. Additionally, a warning
    is raised along with the results:

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", shots=100, wires=2)

        @qml.snapshots
        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit():
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0),
            qml.Snapshot(qml.counts())
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

        with circuit.device.tracker:
            out = circuit()

    >>> circuit.device.tracker.totals
    UserWarning: Snapshots are not supported for the given device. Therefore, a tape will be created for each snapshot, resulting in a total of n_snapshots + 1 executions.
      warnings.warn(
    {'batches': 1,
     'simulations': 2,
     'executions': 2,
     'shots': 200,

    in each resulting tape is minimal:
