    The Hamiltonian is given by

    .. math::

        H = \sum_q \omega_q a^\dagger_q a_q + \sum_{(i, j) \in \mathcal{C}} g_{ij} \left(a^\dagger_i a_j + a_j^\dagger a_i \right)
        + \sum_q \delta_q a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_q a_q a_q

    where :math:`[a^\dagger_p, a_q] = i \delta_{pq}` are bosonic creation and annihilation operators.
    The first term describes the dressed qubit frequencies :math:`\omega_q`, the second term their coupling :math:`g_{ij}` and the last the anharmonicity :math:`\delta_q`,
    which all can vary for different qubits. In practice, the bosonic operators are restricted to a finite dimension of the local Hilbert space (default ``d=2`` corresponds to qubits).
    In that case, the anharmonicity is set to :math:`delta=0` and ignored.

    .. note:: Currently only supporting ``d=2`` with qudit support planned in the future.

    TODO: resource / source for good values.

        :func:`~.transmon_drive`

    Args:
        connections (list[tuple(int)]): List of connections ``(i, j)`` between qubits i and j.
        omega (Union[float, list[float]]): List of dressed qubit frequencies in GHz.
            When passing a single float all qubits are assumed to have that same frequency.
        g (Union[float, list[float]]): List of coupling strengths in GHz. Needs to match the length of ``connections``.
            When passing a single float all connections are assumed to have the same strength.
        delta (Union[float, list[float]]): List of anharmonicities in GHz. Ignored when ``d=2``.
            When passing a single float all qubits are assumed to have that same anharmonicity.
        wires (list): Optional, defaults to the unique wires in ``connections`` when set to ``None``. When passing explicit ``wires``,
            needs to at least contain all unique wires in ``connections`` and can be used to initiate additional, unconnected qubits.
        d (int): Local Hilbert space dimension. Defaults to ``d=2`` and is currently the only supported value.

    Returns:

        :func:`~.transmon_interaction`, :class:`~.ParametrizedHamiltonian`, :class:`~.ParametrizedEvolution`
        and :func:`~.evolve`

    **Example**

    We create a Hamiltonian describing a laser acting on 4 wires (Hardware atoms) with a fixed detuning and
    phase, and a parametrized, time-dependent amplitude. The Hamiltonian includes an interaction term for
    inter-atom interactions due to van der Waals forces, as well as the driving term for the laser driving
    the atoms:

    .. code-block:: python

        atom_coordinates = [[0, 0], [0, 4], [4, 0], [4, 4]]
        H_i = qml.pulse.transmon_interaction(atom_coordinates, wires)

        amplitude = lambda p, t: p * jnp.sin(jnp.pi * t)
        phase = jnp.pi / 2
        detuning = 3 * jnp.pi / 4
        wires = [0, 1, 2, 3]
        H_d = qml.pulse.transmon_drive(amplitude, phase, detuning, wires)

    >>> H_i
    ParametrizedHamiltonian: terms=6
    >>> H_d
    ParametrizedHamiltonian: terms=2

    The two terms of the drive field correspond to the first and second sum, corresponding to the drive and the shift term.
    This drive term corresponds to a global drive that acts on all wires of the device.

    .. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit.jax", wires=wires)

        @qml.qnode(dev, interface="jax")
        def circuit(params):
            qml.evolve(H_i + H_d)(params, t=[0, 10])

    Array(0.97137696, dtype=float32)
    >>> jax.grad(circuit)(params)
    [Array(0.10493923, dtype=float32)]

    We can also create a Hamiltonian with multiple local drives. The following circuit corresponds to the
    evolution where an additional local drive acting on wires ``[0, 1]`` is added to the Hamiltonian:

    .. code-block:: python

        amplitude_local = lambda p, t: p[0] * jnp.sin(2 * jnp.pi * t) + p[1]
        phase_local = jnp.pi / 4
        detuning_local = lambda p, t: p * jnp.exp(-0.25 * t)
        H_local = qml.pulse.transmon_drive(amplitude_local, phase_local, detuning_local, [0, 1])

        H = H_i + H_d + H_local
