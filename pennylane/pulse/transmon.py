    r"""Returns a :class:`ParametrizedHamiltonian` representing the circuit QED Hamiltonian of a
    superconducting transmon system.

    The Hamiltonian is given by

    .. math::

        H = \sum_{q\in \text{wires}} \omega_q b^\dagger_q b_q
        + \sum_{(i, j) \in \mathcal{C}} g_{ij} \left(b^\dagger_i b_j + b_j^\dagger b_i \right)
        + \sum_{q\in \text{wires}} \alpha_q b^\dagger_q b^\dagger_q b_q b_q

    where :math:`[b_p, b_q^\dagger] = \delta_{pq}` are creation and annihilation operators.
    The first term describes the effect of the dressed qubit frequencies ``qubit_freq`` :math:`= \omega_q/ (2\pi)`,
    the second term their ``coupling`` :math:`= g_{ij}/(2\pi)` and the last the
    ``anharmonicity`` :math:`= \alpha_q/(2\pi)`, which all can vary for
    different qubits. In practice, these operators are restricted to a finite dimension of the
    local Hilbert space (default ``d=2`` corresponds to qubits).
    In that case, the anharmonicity is set to :math:`\alpha=0` and ignored.

    The values of :math:`\omega` and :math:`\alpha` are typically around :math:`5 \times 2\pi \text{GHz}`
    and :math:`0.3 \times 2\pi \text{GHz}`, respectively.
    It is common for different qubits to be out of tune with different energy gaps. The coupling strength
    :math:`g` typically varies between :math:`[0.001, 0.1] \times 2\pi \text{GHz}`. For some example parameters,
    see e.g. `arXiv:1804.04073 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04073>`_,
    `arXiv:2203.06818 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06818>`_, or `arXiv:2210.15812 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15812>`_.

    .. note:: Currently only supporting ``d=2`` with qudit support planned in the future. For ``d=2``, we have :math:`b:=\frac{1}{2}(\sigma^x + i \sigma^y)`.

    .. seealso::

        :func:`~.transmon_drive`

    Args:
        qubit_freq (Union[float, list[float], Callable]): List of dressed qubit frequencies. This should be in units
            of frequency (GHz), and will be converted to angular frequency :math:`\omega` internally where
            needed, i.e. multiplied by :math:`2 \pi`. When passing a single float all qubits are assumed to
            have that same frequency. When passing a parametrized function, it must have two
            arguments, the first one being the trainable parameters and the second one being time.
        connections (list[tuple(int)]): List of connections ``(i, j)`` between qubits i and j.
            When the wires in ``connections`` are not contained in ``wires``, a warning is raised.
        coupling (Union[float, list[float]]): List of coupling strengths. This should be in units
            of frequency (GHz), and will be converted to angular frequency internally where
            needed, i.e. multiplied by :math:`2 \pi`. Needs to match the length of ``connections``.
            When passing a single float need explicit ``wires``.
        anharmonicity (Union[float, list[float]]): List of anharmonicities. This should be in units
            of frequency (GHz), and will be converted to angular frequency internally where
            needed, i.e. multiplied by :math:`2 \pi`. Ignored when ``d=2``.
            When passing a single float all qubits are assumed to have that same anharmonicity.
        wires (list): Needs to be of the same length as qubit_freq. Note that there can be additional
            wires in the resulting operator from the ``connections``, which are treated independently.
        d (int): Local Hilbert space dimension. Defaults to ``d=2`` and is currently the only supported value.

    Returns:
        :class:`~.ParametrizedHamiltonian`: a :class:`~.ParametrizedHamiltonian` representing the transmon interaction

    **Example**

    We can set up the transmon interaction Hamiltonian with uniform coefficients by passing ``float`` values.

    .. code-block::

        connections = [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 1], [4, 5]]
        H = qml.pulse.transmon_interaction(qubit_freq=0.5, connections=connections, coupling=1., wires=range(6))

    The resulting :class:`~.HardwareHamiltonian:` consists of ``4`` coupling terms and ``6`` qubits
    because there are six different wire indices in ``connections``.

    >>> print(H)
    HardwareHamiltonian: terms=10

    We can also provide individual values for each of the qubit energies and coupling strengths,
    here of order :math:`0.1 \times 2\pi\text{GHz}` and :math:`1 \times 2\pi\text{GHz}`, respectively.

    .. code-block::

        qubit_freqs = [0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.]
        couplings= [1., 2., 3., 4.]
        H = qml.pulse.transmon_interaction(qubit_freq=qubit_freqs,
                                           connections=connections,
                                           coupling=couplings,
                                           wires=range(6))

    The interaction term is dependent only on the typically fixed transmon energies and coupling strengths.
    Executing this as a pulse program via :func:`~.evolve` would correspond to all driving fields being turned off.
    To add a driving field, see :func:`~.transmon_drive`.

def transmon_drive(amplitude, phase, freq, wires, d=2):
    r"""Returns a :class:`ParametrizedHamiltonian` representing the drive term of a transmon qubit.

    The Hamiltonian is given by

    .. math::

        \Omega(t) \sin\left(\phi(t) + \nu t\right) \sum_q Y_q

    where :math:`\{Y_q\}` are the Pauli-Y operators on ``wires`` :math:`\{q\}`.
    The arguments ``amplitude``, ``phase`` and ``freq`` correspond to :math:`\Omega / (2\pi)`, :math:`\phi`
    and :math:`\nu / (2\pi)`, respectively, and can all be either fixed numbers (``float``) or depend on time
    (``callable``). If they are time-dependent, they need to abide by the restrictions imposed
    in :class:`ParametrizedHamiltonian` and have a signature of two parameters, ``(params, t)``.

    Together with the qubit :math:`Z` terms in :func:`transmon_interaction`, driving with this term can generate
    :math:`X` and :math:`Y` rotations by setting :math:`\phi` accordingly and driving on resonance
    (see eqs. (79) - (92) in `1904.06560 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06560>`_).
    Further, it can generate entangling gates by driving at cross-resonance with a coupled qubit
    (see eqs. (131) - (137) in `1904.06560 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06560>`_).
    Such a coupling is described in :func:`transmon_interaction`.

    For realistic simulations, one may restrict the amplitude, phase and drive frequency parameters.
    For example, the authors in `2008.04302 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04302>`_ impose the restrictions of
    a maximum amplitude :math:`\Omega_{\text{max}} = 20 \text{MHz}` and the carrier frequency to deviate at most
    :math:`\nu - \omega = \pm 1 \text{GHz}` from the qubit frequency :math:`\omega`
    (see :func:`~.transmon_interaction`).
    The phase :math:`\phi(t)` is typically a slowly changing function of time compared to :math:`\Omega(t)`.

    .. note:: Currently only supports ``d=2`` with qudit support planned in the future.
        For ``d>2``, we have :math:`Y \mapsto i (\sigma^- - \sigma^+)`
        with lowering and raising operators  :math:`\sigma^{\mp}`.

    .. note:: Due to convention in the respective fields, we omit the factor :math:`\frac{1}{2}` present in the related constructor :func:`~.rydberg_drive`

    .. seealso::

        :func:`~.rydberg_drive`, :func:`~.transmon_interaction`

    Args:
        amplitude (Union[float, callable]): Float or callable representing the amplitude of the driving field.
            This should be in units of frequency (GHz), and will be converted to angular frequency
            :math:`\Omega(t)` internally where needed, i.e. multiplied by :math:`2 \pi`.
        phase (Union[float, callable]): Float or callable returning phase :math:`\phi(t)` (in radians).
            Can be a fixed number (``float``) or depend on time (``callable``)
        freq (Union[float, callable]): Float or callable representing the frequency of the driving field.
            This should be in units of frequency (GHz), and will be converted to angular frequency
            :math:`\nu(t)` internally where needed, i.e. multiplied by :math:`2 \pi`.
        wires (Union[int, list[int]]): Label of the qubit that the drive acts upon. Can be a list of multiple wires.
        d (int): Local Hilbert space dimension. Defaults to ``d=2`` and is currently the only supported value.

    Returns:
        :class:`~.ParametrizedHamiltonian`: a :class:`~.ParametrizedHamiltonian` representing the transmon interaction

    **Example**

    We can construct a drive term acting on qubit ``0`` in the following way. We parametrize the amplitude and phase
    via :math:`\Omega(t)/(2 \pi) = A \times \sin^2(\pi t)` and :math:`\phi(t) = \phi_0 (t - \frac{1}{2})`. The squared
    sine ensures that the amplitude will be strictly positive (a requirement for some hardware). For simplicity, we
    set the drive frequency to zero :math:`\nu=0`.

    .. code-block:: python3

        def amp(A, t):
            return A * jnp.exp(-t**2)

        def phase(phi0, t):
            return phi0

        freq = 0

        H = qml.pulse.transmon_drive(amp, phase, freq, 0)

        t = 0.
        A = 1.
        phi0 = jnp.pi/2
        params = [A, phi0]

    Evaluated at :math:`t = 0` with the parameters :math:`A = 1` and :math:`\phi_0 = \pi/2` we obtain
    :math:`2 \pi A \exp(0) \sin(\pi/2 + 0)\sigma^y = 2 \pi \sigma^y`.

    >>> H(params, t)
    6.283185307179586*(PauliY(wires=[0]))

    We can combine ``transmon_drive()`` with :func:`~.transmon_interaction` to create a full driven transmon Hamiltonian.
    Let us look at a chain of three transmon qubits that are coupled with their direct neighbors. We provide all
    frequencies in GHz (conversion to angular frequency, i.e. multiplication by :math:`2 \pi`, is taken care of
    internally where needed).

    We use values around :math:`\omega = 5 \times 2\pi \text{GHz}` for resonant frequencies, and coupling strenghts
    on the order of around :math:`g = 0.01 \times 2\pi \text{GHz}`.

    We parametrize the drive Hamiltonians for the qubits with amplitudes as squared sinusodials of
    maximum amplitude :math:`A`, and constant drive frequencies of value :math:`\nu`. We set the
    phase to zero :math:`\phi=0`, and we make the parameters :math:`A` and :math:`\nu` trainable
    for every qubit. We simulate the evolution for a time window of :math:`[0, 5]\text{ns}`.

            return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) + qml.PauliZ(1) + qml.PauliZ(2))

    We evaluate the Hamiltonian with some arbitrarily chosen maximum amplitudes (here on the order of :math:`0.5 \times 2\pi \text{GHz}`)
    and set the drive frequency equal to the qubit frequencies. Note how the order of the construction
    of ``H`` determines the order with which the parameters need to be passed to
    :class:`~.ParametrizedHamiltonian` and :func:`~.evolve`. We made the drive frequencies
    trainable parameters by providing constant callables through :func:`~.pulse.constant` instead of fixed values (like the phase).
    This allows us to differentiate with respect to both the maximum amplitudes and the frequencies and optimize them.
