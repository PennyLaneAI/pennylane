# Release 0.38.0

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h4>Registers of wires 🧸</h4>

* A new function called `qml.registers` has been added that lets you seamlessly create registers of 
  wires.
  [(#5957)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5957)
  [(#6102)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6102)

  Using registers, it is easier to build large algorithms and circuits by applying gates and operations 
  to predefined collections of wires. With `qml.registers`, you can create registers of wires by providing 
  a dictionary whose keys are register names and whose values are the number of wires in each register.

  ```python
  >>> wire_reg = qml.registers({"alice": 4, "bob": 3})
  >>> wire_reg
  {'alice': Wires([0, 1, 2, 3]), 'bob': Wires([4, 5, 6])}
  ```

  The resulting data structure of `qml.registers` is a dictionary with the same register names as keys, 
  but the values are `qml.wires.Wires` instances.

  Nesting registers within other registers can be done by providing a nested dictionary, where the ordering 
  of wire labels is based on the order of appearance and nestedness.

  ```python
  >>> wire_reg = qml.registers({"alice": {"alice1": 1, "alice2": 2}, "bob": {"bob1": 2, "bob2": 1}})
  >>> wire_reg
  {'alice1': Wires([0]), 'alice2': Wires([1, 2]), 'alice': Wires([0, 1, 2]), 'bob1': Wires([3, 4]), 'bob2': Wires([5]), 'bob': Wires([3, 4, 5])}
  ```

  Since the values of the dictionary are `Wires` instances, their use within quantum circuits is very 
  similar to that of a `list` of integers.

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      for w in wire_reg["alice"]:
          qml.Hadamard(w)

      for w in wire_reg["bob1"]:
          qml.RX(0.1967, wires=w)

      qml.CNOT(wires=[wire_reg["alice1"][0], wire_reg["bob2"][0]])

      return [qml.expval(qml.Y(w)) for w in wire_reg["bob1"]]

  print(qml.draw(circuit)())
  ```

  ```pycon
  0: ──H────────╭●─┤     
  1: ──H────────│──┤     
  2: ──H────────│──┤     
  3: ──RX(0.20)─│──┤  <Y>
  4: ──RX(0.20)─│──┤  <Y>
  5: ───────────╰X─┤  
  ```

  In tandem with `qml.registers`, we've also made the following improvements to `qml.wires.Wires`:

  * `Wires` instances now have a more copy-paste friendly representation when printed.
    [(#5958)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5958)

    ```python
    >>> from pennylane.wires import Wires
    >>> w = Wires([1, 2, 3])
    >>> w
    Wires([1, 2, 3])
    ```

  * Python set-based combinations are now supported by `Wires`.
    [(#5983)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5983)

    This new feature unlocks the ability to combine `Wires` instances in the following ways:

    * intersection with `&` or `intersection()`:

      ```python
      >>> wires1 = Wires([1, 2, 3])
      >>> wires2 = Wires([2, 3, 4])
      >>> wires1.intersection(wires2) # or wires1 & wires2
      Wires([2, 3])
      ```

    * symmetric difference with `^` or `symmetric_difference()`:

      ```python
      >>> wires1.symmetric_difference(wires2) # or wires1 ^ wires2
      Wires([1, 4])
      ```

    * union with `|` or `union()`:

      ```python
      >>> wires1.union(wires2) # or wires1 | wires2
      Wires([1, 2, 3, 4])
      ```

    * difference with `-` or `difference()`:

      ```python
      >>> wires1.difference(wires2) # or wires1 - wires2
      Wires([1])
      ```

<h4>Quantum arithmetic operations 🧮</h4>

* Several new operator templates have been added to PennyLane that let you perform quantum arithmetic 
  operations.
  [(#6109)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6109)
  [(#6112)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6112)
  [(#6121)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6121)

  * `qml.Adder` performs in-place modular addition: 
    :math:`\text{Adder}(k, m)\vert x \rangle = \vert x + k \; \text{mod} \; m\rangle`. 

  * `qml.PhaseAdder` is similar to `qml.Adder`, but it performs in-place modular addition in the Fourier 
    basis. 

  * `qml.Multiplier` performs in-place multiplication: 
    :math:`\text{Multiplier}(k, m)\vert x \rangle = \vert x \times k \; \text{mod} \; m \rangle`.

  * `qml.OutAdder` performs out-place modular addition:
    :math:`\text{OutAdder}(m)\vert x \rangle \vert y \rangle \vert b \rangle = \vert x \rangle \vert y \rangle \vert b + x + y \; \text{mod} \; m \rangle`.

  * `qml.OutMultiplier` performs out-place modular multiplication: 
    :math:`\text{OutMultiplier}(m)\vert x \rangle \vert y \rangle \vert b \rangle = \vert x \rangle \vert y \rangle \vert b + x \times y \; \text{mod} \; m \rangle`.

  * `qml.ModExp` performs modular exponentiation: 
    :math:`\text{ModExp}(base, m) \vert x \rangle \vert k \rangle = \vert x \rangle \vert k \times base^x \; \text{mod} \; m \rangle`.

  Here is a comprehensive example that performs the following calculation: `(2 + 1) * 3 mod 7 = 2` (or 
  `010` in binary).

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", shots=1)

  wire_reg = qml.registers({
      "x_wires": 2, # |x>: stores the result of 2 + 1 = 3
      "y_wires": 2, # |y>: multiples x by 3
      "output_wires": 3, # stores the result of (2 + 1) * 3 m 7 = 2
      "work_wires": 2 # for qml.OutMultiplier
  })

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      # In-place addition
      qml.BasisEmbedding(2, wires=wire_reg["x_wires"])
      qml.Adder(1, x_wires=wire_reg["x_wires"]) # add 1 to wires [0, 1] 

      # Out-place multiplication
      qml.BasisEmbedding(3, wires=wire_reg["y_wires"])
      qml.OutMultiplier(
          wire_reg["x_wires"], 
          wire_reg["y_wires"], 
          wire_reg["output_wires"], 
          work_wires=wire_reg["work_wires"], 
          mod=7
      ) 

      return qml.sample(wires=wire_reg["output_wires"])
  ```

  ```
  >>> circuit()
  array([0, 1, 0])
  ```

<h4>Converting noise models from Qiskit ♻️</h4>

* Convert Qiskit noise models into a PennyLane `NoiseModel` with `qml.from_qiskit_noise`.
  [(#5996)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5996)

  In the last few releases, we've added substantial improvements and new features to the 
  [Pennylane-Qiskit plugin](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/qiskit/en/latest/installation.html).
  With this release, a new `qml.from_qiskit_noise` function allows you to convert a Qiskit noise model 
  into a PennyLane `NoiseModel`. Here is a simple example with two quantum errors that add two different 
  depolarizing errors based on the presence of different gates in the circuit:

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  import qiskit_aer.noise as noise

  error_1 = noise.depolarizing_error(0.001, 1) # 1-qubit noise
  error_2 = noise.depolarizing_error(0.01, 2) # 2-qubit noise

  noise_model = noise.NoiseModel()

  noise_model.add_all_qubit_quantum_error(error_1, ['rz', 'ry'])
  noise_model.add_all_qubit_quantum_error(error_2, ['cx'])
  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> qml.from_qiskit_noise(noise_model)
  NoiseModel({
    OpIn(['RZ', 'RY']): QubitChannel(num_kraus=4, num_wires=1)
    OpIn(['CNOT']): QubitChannel(num_kraus=16, num_wires=2)
  })
  ```

  Under the hood, PennyLane converts each quantum error in the Qiskit noise model into an equivalent 
  `qml.QubitChannel` operator with the same canonical 
  [Kraus representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_operation#Kraus_operators). Currently, 
  noise models in PennyLane do not support readout errors. As such, those will be skipped during conversion
  if they are present in the Qiskit noise model.

  Make sure to `pip install pennylane-qiskit` to access this new feature!

<h4>Substantial upgrades to mid-circuit measurements using tree-traversal 🌳</h4>

* The `"tree-traversal"` algorithm for mid-circuit measurements (MCMs) on `default.qubit` has been internally redesigned for better 
  performance.
  [(#5868)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5868)

  In the last release (v0.37), we introduced the tree-traversal MCM method, which was implemented in 
  a recursive way for simplicity. However, this had the unintended consequence of very deep [stack calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack) 
  for circuits with many MCMs, resulting in [stack overflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow) 
  in some cases. With this release, we've refactored the implementation of the tree-traversal method 
  into an iterative approach, which solves those inefficiencies when many MCMs are present in a circuit.
 
* The `tree-traversal` algorithm is now compatible with analytic-mode execution (`shots=None`).
  [(#5868)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5868)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

  n_qubits = 5

  @qml.qnode(dev, mcm_method="tree-traversal")
  def circuit():
      for w in range(n_qubits):
          qml.Hadamard(w)
      
      for w in range(n_qubits - 1):
          qml.CNOT(wires=[w, w+1])

      for w in range(n_qubits):
          m = qml.measure(w)
          qml.cond(m == 1, qml.RX)(0.1967 * (w + 1), w)

      return [qml.expval(qml.Z(w)) for w in range(n_qubits)]
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit()
  [tensor(0.00964158, requires_grad=True),
   tensor(0.03819446, requires_grad=True),
   tensor(0.08455748, requires_grad=True),
   tensor(0.14694258, requires_grad=True),
   tensor(0.2229438, requires_grad=True)]
  ```

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

<h4>Creating spin Hamiltonians</h4>

* Three new functions are now available for creating commonly-used spin Hamiltonians in PennyLane:
  [(#6106)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6106)
  [(#6128)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6128)

  * `qml.spin.transverse_ising` creates the [transverse-field Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse-field_Ising_model) Hamiltonian.
  * `qml.spin.heisenberg` creates the [Heisenberg model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Heisenberg_model) Hamiltonian.
  * `qml.spin.fermi_hubbard` creates the [Fermi-Hubbard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbard_model) Hamiltonian.

  Each Hamiltonian can be instantiated by specifying a `lattice`, the number of [unit cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_cell), 
  `n_cells`, and the Hamiltonian parameters as keyword arguments. Here is an example with the transverse-field 
  Ising model:

  ```pycon
  >>> tfim_ham = qml.spin.transverse_ising(lattice="square", n_cells=[2, 2], coupling=0.5, h=0.2)
  >>> tfim_ham
  (
      -0.5 * (Z(0) @ Z(1))
    + -0.5 * (Z(0) @ Z(2))
    + -0.5 * (Z(1) @ Z(3))
    + -0.5 * (Z(2) @ Z(3))
    + -0.2 * X(0)
    + -0.2 * X(1)
    + -0.2 * X(2)
    + -0.2 * X(3)
  )
  ```

  The resulting object is a `qml.Hamiltonian` instance, making it easy to use in circuits like the following.

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", shots=1)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      return qml.expval(tfim_ham)
  ```

  ```
  >>> circuit()
  -2.0
  ```

  More features will be added to the `qml.spin` module in the coming releases, so stay tuned!

<h4>A Prep-Select-Prep template</h4>

* A new template called `qml.PrepSelPrep` has been added that implements a block-encoding of a linear
  combination of unitaries. 
  [(#5756)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5756)
  [(#5987)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5987)

  This operator acts as a nice wrapper for having to perform `qml.StatePrep`, `qml.Select`, and `qml.adjoint(qml.StatePrep)`
  in succession, which is quite common in many quantum algorithms (e.g., [LCU and block encoding](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_lcu_blockencoding/)). Here is an example showing the equivalence
  between using `qml.PrepSelPrep` and `qml.StatePrep`, `qml.Select`, and `qml.adjoint(qml.StatePrep)`.

  ```python
  coeffs = [0.3, 0.1]
  alphas = (np.sqrt(coeffs) / np.linalg.norm(np.sqrt(coeffs)))
  unitaries = [qml.X(2), qml.Z(2)]

  lcu = qml.dot(coeffs, unitaries)
  control = [0, 1]

  def prep_sel_prep(alphas, unitaries):
      qml.StatePrep(alphas, wires=control, pad_with=0)
      qml.Select(unitaries, control=control)
      qml.adjoint(qml.StatePrep)(alphas, wires=control, pad_with=0)

  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
  def circuit(lcu, control, alphas, unitaries):
      qml.PrepSelPrep(lcu, control)
      qml.adjoint(prep_sel_prep)(alphas, unitaries)
      return qml.state()
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> np.round(circuit(lcu, control, alphas, unitaries), decimals=2)
  tensor([1.+0.j -0.+0.j -0.+0.j -0.+0.j  0.+0.j  0.+0.j  0.+0.j  0.+0.j], requires_grad=True)
  ```

<h4>QChem improvements</h4>

* Molecules and Hamiltonians can now be constructed for all the elements present in the periodic table.
  [(#5821)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5821)

  This new feature is made possible by integrating with the [basis-set-exchange package](https://pypi.org/project/basis-set-exchange/).
  If loading basis sets from `basis-set-exchange` is needed for your molecule, make sure that you 
  `pip install basis-set-exchange` and set `load_data=True`.

  ```python
  symbols  = ['Ti', 'Ti']
  geometry = np.array([[0.0, 0.0, -1.1967],
                      [0.0, 0.0,  1.1967]], requires_grad=True)
  mol = qml.qchem.Molecule(symbols, geometry, load_data=True)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> mol.n_electrons
  44
  ```

* `qml.UCCSD` now accepts an additional optional argument, `n_repeats`, which defines the number of
  times the UCCSD template is repeated. This can improve the accuracy of the template by reducing
  the Trotter error, but would result in deeper circuits.
  [(#5801)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5801)

* The `qml.qchem.qubit_observable` function has been modified to return an ascending wire order for molecular 
  Hamiltonians.
  [(#5950)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5950)

* A new method called `to_mat` has been added to the `qml.FermiWord` and `qml.FermiSentence` classes, 
  which allows for computing the matrix representation of these Fermi operators.
  [(#5920)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5920)

<h4>Improvements to operators</h4>

* `qml.GlobalPhase` now supports parameter broadcasting.
  [(#5923)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5923)

* `qml.Hermitian` now has a `compute_decomposition` method.
  [(#6062)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6062)

* The implementation of `qml.PhaseShift`, `qml.S`, and `qml.T` has been improved, resulting in faster
  circuit execution times.
  [(#5876)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5876)

* The `qml.CNOT` operator no longer decomposes into itself. Instead, it raises a `qml.DecompositionUndefinedError`.
  [(#6039)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6039)

<h4>Mid-circuit measurements</h4>

* The `qml.dynamic_one_shot` transform now supports circuits using the `"tensorflow"` interface.
  [(#5973)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5973)

* If the conditional does not include a mid-circuit measurement, then `qml.cond`
  will automatically evaluate conditionals using standard Python control flow.
  [(#6016)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6016)

  This allows `qml.cond` to be used to represent a wider range of conditionals:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=1)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      c = qml.cond(x > 2.7, qml.RX, qml.RZ)
      c(x, wires=0)
      return qml.probs(wires=0)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)(3.8))
  0: ──RX(3.80)─┤  Probs
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)(0.54))
  0: ──RZ(0.54)─┤  Probs
  ```

<h4>Transforms</h4>

* `qml.transforms.single_qubit_fusion` and `qml.transforms.merge_rotations` now respect global phases.
  [(#6031)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6031)

* A new transform called `qml.transforms.diagonalize_measurements` has been added. This transform converts 
  measurements to the computational basis by applying the relevant diagonalizing gates. It can be set 
  to diagonalize only a subset of the base observables `{qml.X, qml.Y, qml.Z, qml.Hadamard}`.
  [(#5829)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5829)

* A new transform called `split_to_single_terms` has been added. This transform splits expectation values 
  of sums into multiple single-term measurements on a single tape, providing better support for simulators
  that can handle non-commuting observables but don't natively support multi-term observables.
  [(#5884)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5884)

* New functionality has been added to natively support exponential extrapolation when using `qml.transforms.mitigate_with_zne`. 
  This allows users to have more control over the error mitigation protocol without needing to add further 
  dependencies.
  [(#5972)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5972)

<h4>Capturing and representing hybrid programs</h4>

* `qml.for_loop` now supports `range`-like syntax with default `step=1`.
  [(#6068)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6068)

* Applying `adjoint` and `ctrl` to a quantum function can now be captured into plxpr. Furthermore, the 
  `qml.cond` function can be captured into plxpr.
  [(#5966)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5966)
  [(#5967)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5967)
  [(#5999)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5999)
  [(#6058)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6058)

* During experimental program capture, functions that accept and/or return `pytree` structures can now 
  be handled in the `qml.QNode` call, `qml.cond`, `qml.for_loop` and `qml.while_loop`. 
  [(#6081)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6081)

* During experimental program capture, QNodes can now use closure variables.
  [(#6052)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6052)

* Mid-circuit measurements can now be captured with `qml.capture` enabled.
  [(#6015)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6015)

* `qml.for_loop` can now be captured into plxpr.
  [(#6041)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6041)
  [(#6064)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6064)

* `qml.for_loop` and `qml.while_loop` now fall back to standard Python control flow if `@qjit` is not 
  present, allowing the same code to work with and without `@qjit` without any rewrites.
  [(#6014)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6014)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=3)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x, n):

      @qml.for_loop(0, n, 1)
      def init_state(i):
          qml.Hadamard(wires=i)

      init_state()

          @qml.for_loop(i + 1, n, 1)
          def inner(j):
              qml.CRY(x**2, [i, j])

          inner()

  ```

<h4>Community contributions 🥳</h4>

* Fixed a bug in `qml.ThermalRelaxationError` where there was a typo from `tq` to `tg`.
  [(#5988)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/issues/5988)

* Readout error has been added using parameters `readout_relaxation_probs` and `readout_misclassification_probs` 
  on the `default.qutrit.mixed` device. These parameters add a `qml.QutritAmplitudeDamping`  and a `qml.TritFlip` 
  channel, respectively, after measurement diagonalization. The amplitude damping error represents the 
  potential for relaxation to occur during longer measurements. The trit flip error represents misclassification 
  during readout.
  [(#5842)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5842)

* `qml.ops.qubit.BasisStateProjector` now has a `compute_sparse_matrix` method that computes the sparse 
  CSR matrix representation of the projector onto the given basis state.
  [(#5790)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5790)

<h4>Other improvements</h4>

* `qml.pauli.group_observables` now uses `rustworkx` colouring algorithms to solve the 
  [Minimum Clique Cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_cover), resulting in orders of
  magnitude performance improvements.
  [(#6043)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6043)

  This adds two new options for the `method` argument: `dsatur` (degree of saturation) and `gis` (independent 
  set). In addition, the creation of the adjacency matrix now takes advantage of the symplectic representation 
  of the Pauli observables. 
  
  Additionally, a new function called `qml.pauli.compute_partition_indices` has been added to calculate 
  the indices from the partitioned observables more efficiently. These changes improve the wall time 
  of `qml.LinearCombination.compute_grouping` and the `grouping_type='qwc'` by orders of magnitude. 

* `qml.counts` measurements with `all_outcomes=True` can now be used with JAX jitting. Additionally, 
  measurements broadcasted across all available wires (e.g., `qml.probs()`) can now be used with JAX 
  jit and devices that allow dynamic numbers of wires (only `'default.qubit'` currently).
  [(#6108)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6108/)

* `qml.ops.op_math.ctrl_decomp_zyz` can now decompose special unitaries with multiple control wires.
  [(#6042)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6042)

* A new method called `process_density_matrix` has been added to the `ProbabilityMP` and `DensityMatrixMP`
  measurement processes, allowing for more efficient handling of quantum density matrices, particularly 
  with batch processing support. This method simplifies the calculation of probabilities from quantum 
  states represented as density matrices.
  [(#5830)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5830)

* `SProd.terms` now flattens out the terms if the base is a multi-term observable.
  [(#5885)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5885)

* `qml.QNGOptimizer` now supports cost functions with multiple arguments, updating each argument independently.
  [(#5926)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5926)

* `semantic_version` has been removed from the list of required packages in PennyLane. 
  [(#5836)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5836)

* `qml.devices.LegacyDeviceFacade` has been added to map the legacy devices to the new device interface, 
  making it easier for developers to develop legacy devices.
  [(#5927)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5927)

* `StateMP.process_state` now defines rules in `cast_to_complex` for complex casting, avoiding a superfluous 
  statevector copy in PennyLane-Lightning simulations.
  [(#5995)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5995)

* `QuantumScript.hash` is now cached, leading to performance improvements.
  [(#5919)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5919)

* Observable validation for `default.qubit` is now based on execution mode (analytic vs. finite shots) 
  and measurement type (sample measurement vs. state measurement). This improves our error handling when, 
  for example, non-hermitian operators are given to `qml.expval`.
  [(#5890)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5890)

* A new `is_leaf` parameter has been added to the function `flatten` in the `qml.pytrees` module. This 
  is to allow for node flattening to be stopped for any node where the `is_leaf` optional argument evaluates 
  to being `True`.
  [(#6107)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/issues/6107)

* A progress bar has been added to `qml.data.load()` when downloading a dataset.
  [(#5560)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5560)

* Upgraded and simplified `StatePrep` and `AmplitudeEmbedding` templates.
  [(#6034)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6034)
  [(#6170)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6170)

* Upgraded and simplified `BasisState` and `BasisEmbedding` templates.
  [(#6021)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6021)
  
<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* `MeasurementProcess.shape(shots: Shots, device:Device)` is now
  `MeasurementProcess.shape(shots: Optional[int], num_device_wires:int = 0)`. This has been done to 
  allow for jitting when a measurement is broadcasted across all available wires, but the device does 
  not specify wires.
  [(#6108)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6108/)

* If the shape of a probability measurement is affected by a `Device.cutoff` property, it will no longer 
  work with jitting.
  [(#6108)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6108/)

* `qml.GlobalPhase` is considered non-differentiable with tape transforms. As a consequence, `qml.gradients.finite_diff` 
  and `qml.gradients.spsa_grad` no longer support differentiating `qml.GlobalPhase` with state-based 
  outputs.
  [(#5620)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5620) 

* The `CircuitGraph.graph` `rustworkx` graph now stores indices into the circuit as the node labels,
  instead of the operator/ measurement itself. This allows the same operator to occur multiple times 
  in the circuit.
  [(#5907)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5907)

* The `queue_idx` attribute has been removed from the `Operator`, `CompositeOp`, and `SymbolicOp` classes.
  [(#6005)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6005)

* `qml.from_qasm` no longer removes measurements from the QASM code. Use `measurements=[]` to remove 
  measurements from the original circuit.
  [(#5982)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5982)

* `qml.transforms.map_batch_transform` has been removed, since transforms can be applied directly to 
  a batch of tapes. See `qml.transform` for more information.
  [(#5981)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5981)

* `QuantumScript.interface` has been removed.
  [(#5980)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5980)

  for equivalent behaviour.
  [(#5994)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5994)

* `qml.transforms.sum_expand` and `qml.transforms.hamiltonian_expand` have been deprecated. Users should

  [(#5984)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5984)

* The `max_expansion` argument in `qml.execute` has been deprecated.
  Instead, please use `qml.devices.preprocess.decompose` with the desired expansion level, add it to

  [(#5984)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5984)

* `qml.qinfo.classical_fisher` and `qml.qinfo.quantum_fisher` have been deprecated.
  Instead, use `qml.gradients.classical_fisher` and `qml.gradients.quantum_fisher`.
  [(#5985)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5985)

* The legacy devices `default.qubit.{autograd,torch,tf,jax,legacy}` have been deprecated.
  Instead, use `default.qubit`, as it now supports backpropagation through the several backends.
  [(#5997)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5997)

* The logic for internally switching a device for a different backpropagation
  compatible device is now deprecated, as it was in place for the deprecated
  `default.qubit.legacy`.
  [(#6032)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6032)

  batch size.
  [(#6147)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6147)

* Catalyst replaced `argnum` with `argnums` in gradient related functions, therefore we updated the Catalyst
  calls to those functions in PennyLane.
  [(#6117)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6117)

* `fuse_rot_angles` now returns NaN instead of incorrect derivatives at singular points.

  [(#6024)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6024)

* `CircuitGraph` can now handle circuits with the same operation instance occuring multiple times.
  [(#5907)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5907)

* `qml.QSVT` has been updated to store wire order correctly.
  [(#5959)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5959)

* `qml.devices.qubit.measure_with_samples` now returns the correct result if the provided measurements
  contain a sum of operators acting on the same wire.
  [(#5978)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5978)

* `qml.AmplitudeEmbedding` has better support for features using low precision integer data types.
  [(#5969)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5969)

* `qml.BasisState` and `qml.BasisEmbedding` now works with jax.jit, `lightning.qubit`, and give the correct 
  decomposition.

  an incorrect matrix to be generated for `Prod` with `Sum` as operands.
  [(#6091)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6091)

* `qml.qsvt` now works with "Wx" convention and any number of angles.
