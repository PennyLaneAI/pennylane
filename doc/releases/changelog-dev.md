# Release 0.22.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* New functions and transforms of operators have been added. These include:

  - `qml.matrix()` for computing the matrix representation of one or more unitary operators.
    [(#2241)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2241)
    
  - `qml.eigvals()` for computing the eigenvalues of one or more operators.
    [(#2248)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2248)

  - `qml.generator()` for computing the generator of a single-parameter unitary operation.
    [(#2256)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2256)

  All operator transforms can be used on instantiated operators,

  ```pycon
  >>> op = qml.RX(0.54, wires=0)
  >>> qml.matrix(op)
  [[0.9637709+0.j         0.       -0.26673144j]
  [0.       -0.26673144j 0.9637709+0.j        ]]
  ```

  Operator transforms can also be used in a functional form:

  ```pycon
  >>> x = torch.tensor(0.6, requires_grad=True)
  >>> matrix_fn = qml.matrix(qml.RX)
  >>> matrix_fn(x)
  tensor([[0.9553+0.0000j, 0.0000-0.2955j],
          [0.0000-0.2955j, 0.9553+0.0000j]], grad_fn=<AddBackward0>)
  ```

  In its functional form, it is fully differentiable with respect to gate arguments:

  ```pycon
  >>> loss = torch.real(torch.trace(matrix_fn(x, wires=0)))
  >>> loss.backward()
  >>> x.grad
  tensor(-0.5910)
  ```

  Some operator transform can also act on multiple operations, by passing
  quantum functions or tapes:

  ```pycon
  >>> def circuit(theta):
  ...     qml.RX(theta, wires=1)
  ...     qml.PauliZ(wires=0)
  >>> qml.matrix(circuit)(np.pi / 4)
  array([[ 0.92387953+0.j,  0.+0.j ,  0.-0.38268343j,  0.+0.j],
  [ 0.+0.j,  -0.92387953+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0. +0.38268343j],
  [ 0. -0.38268343j,  0.+0.j,  0.92387953+0.j,  0.+0.j],
  [ 0.+0.j,  0.+0.38268343j,  0.+0.j,  -0.92387953+0.j]])
  ```

* Added the user-interface for mid-circuit measurements.
  [(#2236)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2236)

* A new transform has been added to construct the pairwise-commutation directed acyclic graph (DAG)
  representation of a quantum circuit.
  [(#1712)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1712)

  In the DAG, each node represents a quantum operation, and edges represent non-commutation
  between two operations.

  This transform takes into account that not all operations can be moved next to each other by
  pairwise commutation:
  
  ```pycon
  >>> def circuit(x, y, z):
  ...     qml.RX(x, wires=0)
  ...     qml.RX(y, wires=0)
  ...     qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 2])
  ...     qml.RY(y, wires=1)
  ...     qml.Hadamard(wires=2)
  ...     qml.CRZ(z, wires=[2, 0])
  ...     qml.RY(-y, wires=1)
  ...     return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  >>> dag_fn = commutation_dag(circuit)
  >>> dag = dag_fn(np.pi / 4, np.pi / 3, np.pi / 2)
  ```

  Nodes in the commutation DAG can be accessed via the `get_nodes()` method, returning a list of 
  the  form `(ID, CommutationDAGNode)`:

  ```pycon
  nodes = dag.get_nodes()
  [(0, <pennylane.transforms.commutation_dag.CommutationDAGNode object at 0x132b03b20>), ...]
  ```

  Specific nodes in the commutation DAG can be accessed via the `get_node()` method:
  
  ```
  >>> second_node = dag.get_node(2)
  >>> second_node
  <pennylane.transforms.commutation_dag.CommutationDAGNode object at 0x136f8c4c0>
  >>> second_node.op
  CNOT(wires=[1, 2])
  >>> second_node.successors
  [3, 4, 5, 6]
  >>> second_node.predecessors
  []
  ```

* The text based drawer accessed via `qml.draw` has been overhauled.
  [(#2128)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2128)
  [(#2198)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2198)

  The new drawer has:

  * a `decimals` keyword for controlling parameter rounding
  * a `show_matrices` keyword for controlling display of matrices
  * a different algorithm for determining positions
  * deprecation of the `charset` keyword
  * additional minor cosmetic changes

  ```python
  @qml.qnode(qml.device('lightning.qubit', wires=2))
  def circuit(a, w):
      qml.Hadamard(0)
      qml.CRX(a, wires=[0, 1])
      qml.Rot(*w, wires=[1])
      qml.CRX(-a, wires=[0, 1])
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit, decimals=2)(a=2.3, w=[1.2, 3.2, 0.7]))
  0: ──H─╭C─────────────────────────────╭C─────────┤ ╭<Z@Z>
  1: ────╰RX(2.30)──Rot(1.20,3.20,0.70)─╰RX(-2.30)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>
  ```

* Parametric operations now have the `parameter_frequencies`
  method that returns the frequencies with which a parameter
  enters a circuit. In addition, the general parameter-shift
  rule is now automatically used by `qml.gradients.param_shift`.
  [(#2180)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2180)
  [(#2182)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2182)
  [(#2227)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2227)

  The frequencies can be used for circuit analysis, optimization
  via the `RotosolveOptimizer` and differentiation with the
  parameter-shift rule. They assume that the circuit returns
  expectation values or probabilities, for a variance
  measurement the frequencies will differ.

  By default, the frequencies will be obtained from the
  `generator` property (if it is defined).

  When using `qml.gradients.param_shift`, either a custom `grad_recipe`
  or the parameter frequencies are used to obtain the shift rule
  for the operation, in that order of preference.

  See [Vidal and Theis (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06323)
  and [Wierichs et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12390)
  for theoretical background information on the general
  parameter-shift rule.

* Continued development of the circuit-cutting compiler:

  - A method for converting a quantum tape to a directed multigraph that is amenable
    to graph partitioning algorithms for circuit cutting has been added.
    [(#2107)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2107)

  - A method to replace `WireCut` nodes in a directed multigraph with `MeasureNode`
    and `PrepareNode` placeholders has been added.
    [(#2124)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2124)

  - A method has been added that takes a directed multigraph with `MeasureNode` and
    `PrepareNode` placeholders and fragments into subgraphs and a communication graph.
    [(#2153)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2153)

  - A method has been added that takes a directed multigraph with `MeasureNode`
    and `PrepareNode` placeholder nodes and converts it into a tape.
    [(#2165)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2165)

  - A differentiable tensor contraction function `contract_tensors` has been
    added.
    [(#2158)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2158)
  
  - A method has been added that expands a quantum tape over `MeasureNode` and `PrepareNode`
    configurations.
    [(#2169)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2169)

  - The postprocessing function for the `cut_circuit` transform has been added.
    [(#2192)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2192)

  - The `cut_circuit` transform has been added.
    [(#2216)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2216)

  - A class `CutStrategy` which acts as an interface and coordinates device/user
    constraints with circuit execution requirements to come up with the best sets
    of graph partitioning parameters.
    [(#2168)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2168)

  - A suite of integration tests has been added.
    [(#2231)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2231)
    [(#2234)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2234)
    [(#2244)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2244)
    [(#2251)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2251)
    [(#2265)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2265)

  - Circuit fragments that are disconnected from the terminal measurements are now removed.
    [(#2254)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2254)
  
  - `WireCut` operations that do not lead to a disconnection are now being removed.
    [(#2260)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2260)
  
  - Circuit cutting now remaps the wires of fragment circuits to match the available wires on the
    device.
    [(#2257)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2257)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* No two-term parameter-shift rule is assumed anymore by default.
  [(#2227)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2227)

  Previously, operations marked for analytic differentiation that
  do not provide a `generator`, `parameter_frequencies` or a
  custom `grad_recipe` were assumed to satisfy the two-term shift
  rule. This now has to be made explicit for custom operations
  by adding any of the above attributes.

* The `qml.draw_mpl` transform supports a `expansion_strategy` keyword argument.
  [(#2271)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2271/)

* The `qml.gradients` module has been streamlined and special-purpose functions
  moved closer to their use cases, while preserving existing behaviour.
  [(#2200)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2200)

* Added a new `partition_pauli_group` function to the `grouping` module for
  efficiently measuring the `N`-qubit Pauli group with `3 ** N`
  qubit-wise commuting terms.
  [(#2185)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2185)
  
  ```pycon
  >>> qml.grouping.partition_pauli_group(2)
  [['II', 'IZ', 'ZI', 'ZZ'],
   ['IX', 'ZX'],
   ['IY', 'ZY'],
   ['XI', 'XZ'],
   ['XX'],
   ['XY'],
   ['YI', 'YZ'],
   ['YX'],
   ['YY']]
  ```

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* The `MultiControlledX` operation now accepts a single `wires` keyword argument for both `control_wires` and `wires`.
  The single `wires` keyword should be all the control wires followed by a single target wire. 
  [(#2121)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2121)

<h3>Deprecations</h3>

* The `qml.operation.Operation.get_parameter_shift` method has been deprecated
  and will be removed in a future release.
  [#2227](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2227)

  Instead, the functionalities for general parameter-shift rules in the
  `qml.gradients` module should be used, together with the operation attributes
  `parameter_frequencies` or `grad_recipe`.

* The `qml.finite_diff()` function has been deprecated and will be removed
  in an upcoming release. Instead,
  `qml.gradients.finite_diff()` can be used to compute purely quantum gradients
  (that is, gradients of tapes or QNode).
  [#2212](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2212)

* `qml.transforms.get_unitary_matrix()` has been deprecated and will be removed
  in a future release. For extracting matrices of operations and quantum functions,
  please use `qml.matrix()`.
  [(#2248)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2248)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* The `qml.RandomLayers` template now decomposes when the weights are a list of lists.
  [(#2266)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2266/)

* The `qml.QubitUnitary` operation now supports jitting. 
  [(#2249)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2249)
  
* Fixes a bug in the JAX interface where ``DeviceArray`` objects
  were not being converted to NumPy arrays before executing an
  external device.
  [(#2255)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2255)

* The ``qml.ctrl`` transform now works correctly with gradient transforms
  such as the parameter-shift rule.
  [(#2238)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2238)

* Fixes a bug in which passing required arguments into operations as
  keyword arguments would throw an error because the documented call
  signature didn't match the function definition.
  [(#1976)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1976)

* The operation `OrbitalRotation` previously was wrongfully registered to satisfy
  the four-term parameter shift rule. The correct eight-term rule will now be used when
  using the parameter-shift rule.
  [(#2180)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2180)

<h3>Documentation</h3>

* Link to the strawberry fields docs for information on the CV model.
  [(#2259)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2259)

* Fixes the documentation example for `qml.QFT`.
  [(#2232)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2232)

* Fixes the documentation example for using `qml.sample` with `jax.jit`.
  [(#2196)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2196)

* The `qml.numpy` subpackage is now included in the PennyLane
  API documentation.
  [(#2179)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2179)

* Improves the documentation of `RotosolveOptimizer` regarding the
  usage of the passed `substep_optimizer` and its keyword arguments.
  [(#2160)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2160)

<h3>Operator class refactor</h3>

The Operator class has undergone a major refactor with the following changes:

* The static `compute_decomposition` method defines the decomposition
  of an operator into a product of simpler operators, and the instance method
  `decomposition()` computes this for a given instance. When a custom
  decomposition does not exist, the code now raises a custom `NoDecompositionError`
  instead of `NotImplementedError`.
  [(#2024)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2024)

* The `diagonalizing_gates()` representation has been moved to the highest-level
  `Operator` class and is therefore available to all subclasses. A condition
  `qml.operation.defines_diagonalizing_gates` has been added, which can be used
  in tape contexts without queueing.
  [(#1985)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1985)

* A static `compute_diagonalizing_gates` method has been added, which is called
  by default in `diagonalizing_gates()`.
  [(#1993)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1993)

* A `hyperparameters` attribute was added to the operator class.
  [(#2017)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2017)

* The representation of an operator as a matrix has been overhauled.

  The `matrix()` method now accepts a
  `wire_order` argument and calculates the correct numerical representation
  with respect to that ordering.

  ```pycon
  >>> op = qml.RX(0.5, wires="b")
  >>> op.matrix()
  [[0.96891242+0.j         0.        -0.24740396j]
   [0.        -0.24740396j 0.96891242+0.j        ]]
  >>> op.matrix(wire_order=["a", "b"])
  [[0.9689+0.j  0.-0.2474j 0.+0.j         0.+0.j]
   [0.-0.2474j  0.9689+0.j 0.+0.j         0.+0.j]
   [0.+0.j          0.+0.j 0.9689+0.j 0.-0.2474j]
   [0.+0.j          0.+0.j 0.-0.2474j 0.9689+0.j]]
  ```

  The "canonical matrix", which is independent of wires,
  is now defined in the static method `compute_matrix()` instead of `_matrix`.
  By default, this method is assumed to take all parameters and non-trainable
  hyperparameters that define the operation.

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.RX.compute_matrix(0.5)
  [[0.96891242+0.j         0.        -0.24740396j]
   [0.        -0.24740396j 0.96891242+0.j        ]]
  ```

  If no canonical matrix is specified for a gate, `compute_matrix()`
  raises a `NotImplementedError`.

  The new `matrix()` method is now used in the
  `pennylane.transforms.get_qubit_unitary()` transform.
  [(#1996)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1996)

* The `string_for_inverse` attribute is removed.
  [(#2021)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2021)

* A `terms()` method and a `compute_terms()` static method were added to `Operator`.
  Currently, only the `Hamiltonian` class overwrites `compute_terms` to store
  coefficients and operators. The `Hamiltonian.terms` property hence becomes
  a proper method called by `Hamiltonian.terms()`.

* The generator property has been updated to an instance method,
  `Operator.generator()`. It now returns an instantiated operation,
  representing the generator of the instantiated operator.
  [(#2030)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2030)
  [(#2061)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2061)

  Various operators have been updated to specify the generator as either
  an `Observable`, `Tensor`, `Hamiltonian`, `SparseHamiltonian`, or `Hermitian`
  operator.

  In addition, a temporary utility function get_generator has been added
  to the utils module, to automate:

  - Extracting the matrix representation
  - Extracting the 'coefficient' if possible (only occurs if the generator is a single Pauli word)
  - Converting a Hamiltonian to a sparse matrix if there are more than 1 Pauli word present.
  - Negating the coefficient/taking the adjoint of the matrix if the operation was inverted

  This utility logic is currently needed because:

  - Extracting the matrix representation is not supported natively on
    Hamiltonians and SparseHamiltonians.
  - By default, calling `op.generator()` does not take into account `op.inverse()`.
  - If the generator is a single Pauli word, it is convenient to have access to
    both the coefficient and the observable separately.

* Decompositions are now defined in `compute_decomposition`, instead of `expand`.
  [(#2053)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2053)

* The `expand` method was moved to the main `Operator` class.
  [(#2053)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2053)

* A `sparse_matrix` method and a `compute_sparse_matrix` static method were added
  to the `Operator` class. The sparse representation of `SparseHamiltonian`
  is moved to this method, so that its `matrix` method now returns a dense matrix.
  [(#2050)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2050)

* The argument `wires` in `heisenberg_obs`, `heisenberg_expand` and `heisenberg_tr`
  was renamed to `wire_order` to be consistent with other matrix representations.
  [(#2051)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2051)

* The property `kraus_matrices` has been changed to a method, and `_kraus_matrices` renamed to
  `compute_kraus_matrices`, which is now a static method.
  [(#2055)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2055)

* The developer guide on adding templates and the architecture overview were rewritten
  to reflect the past and planned changes of the operator refactor.
  [(#2066)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2066)

* Custom errors subclassing ``OperatorPropertyUndefined`` are raised if a representation
  has not been defined. This replaces the ``NotImplementedError`` and allows finer control
  for developers.
  [(#2064)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2064)

* Moved ``expand()`` from ``Operation`` to ``Operator``.
  [(#2239)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2239)
