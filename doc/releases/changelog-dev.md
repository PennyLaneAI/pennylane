# Release 0.30.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* The `sample_state` function is added to `devices/qubit` that returns a series of samples based on a given
  state vector and a number of shots.
  [(#3720)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3720)

* The `simulate` function added to `devices/qubit` now supports measuring expectation values of large observables such as
  `qml.Hamiltonian`, `qml.SparseHamiltonian`, `qml.Sum`.
  [(#3759)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3759)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* `Operator` now has a `has_generator` attribute that returns whether or not the operator
  has a generator defined. It is used in `qml.operation.has_gen`, improving its performance.
  [(#3875)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3875)

* The custom JVP rules in PennyLane now also support non-scalar and mixed-shape tape parameters as
  well as multi-dimensional tape return types, like broadcasted `qml.probs`, for example.
  [(#3766)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3766)

* The `qchem.jordan_wigner` function is extended to support more fermionic operator orders.
  [(#3754)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3754)
  [(#3751)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3751)

* `AdaptiveOptimizer` is updated to use non-default user-defined qnode arguments.
  [(#3765)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3765)

* The `apply_operation` function added to `devices/qubit` now supports broadcasting.
  [(#3852)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3852)

* `qml.QubitStateVector.state_vector` now supports broadcasting.
  [(#3852)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3852)
  
* `pennylane.devices.qubit.preprocess` now allows circuits with non-commuting observables.
  [(#3857)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3857)

* When using Jax-jit with gradient transforms the trainable parameters are correctly set (instead of every parameter 
  to be set as trainable), and therefore the derivatives are computed more efficiently.
  [(#3697)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3697)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* An operation that implements a custom `generator` method, but does not always return a valid generator, also has
  to implement a `has_generator` property that reflects in which scenarios a generator will be returned.
  [(#3875)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3875)
 
* Trainable parameters for the Jax interface are the parameters that are `JVPTracer`, defined by setting
  `argnums`. Previously, all JAX tracers, including those used for JIT compilation, were interpreted to be trainable.
  [(#3697)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3697)

* The keyword argument `argnums` is now used for gradient transform using Jax, instead of `argnum`.
  `argnum` is automatically converted to `argnums` when using JAX, and will no longer be supported in v0.31.
  [(#3697)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3697)

* Made `qml.OrbitalRotation` and consequently `qml.GateFabric` consistent with the interleaved Jordan-Wigner ordering.
  Previously, they were consistent with the sequential Jordan-Wigner ordering.
  [(#3861)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3861)

<h3>Deprecations</h3>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

* A typo was corrected in the documentation for introduction to `inspecting_circuits` and `chemistry`.
[(#3844)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3844)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Registers `math.ndim` and `math.shape` for built-ins and autograd to accomodate Autoray 0.6.1.
  [#3864](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3865)

* Ensure that `qml.data.load` returns datasets in a stable and expected order.
  [(#3856)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3856)

* The `qml.equal` function now handles comparisons of `ParametrizedEvolution` operators.
  [(#3870)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3870)

* Made `qml.OrbitalRotation` and consequently `qml.GateFabric` consistent with the interleaved Jordan-Wigner ordering.
