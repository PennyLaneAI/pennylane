# Release 0.40.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h4>Efficient state preparation methods ü¶æ</h4>

* Added new ``MPSPrep`` template to prepare quantum states in tensor simulators.
  [(#6431)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6431)

* Users can prepare a linear combination of basis states using `qml.Superposition`.
  [(#6670)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6670)

  ```python
  coeffs = np.array([0.70710678, 0.70710678])
  basis =  np.array([[0, 0], [1, 0]])

  @qml.qnode(qml.device('default.qubit', wires=2))
  def circuit():
      qml.Superposition(coeffs, basis)
      return qml.state()
  ```
  ```
  >>> circuit()
  tensor([0.70710678+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.70710678+0.j, 0.+0.j], requires_grad=True)
  ```

  This template is also JAX-jit compatible!

<h4>Enhanced QSVT functionality ü§©</h4>

* New functionality to calculate angles for QSP and QSVT has been added. This includes the function `qml.poly_to_angles`
  to obtain angles directly and the function `qml.transform_angles` to convert angles from one subroutine to another.
  [(#6483)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6483)

* The `qml.qsvt` function has been improved to be more user-friendly. Old functionality is moved to `qml.qsvt_legacy`
  and it will be deprecated in release v0.40.
  [(#6520)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6520/)
  [(#6693)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6693)

  [(#6565)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6565)

<h4>Generalized Trotter products üêñ</h4>

* Added a function `qml.trotterize` to generalize the Suzuki-Trotter product to arbitrary quantum functions.
  [(#6627)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6627)

  ```python
  def my_custom_first_order_expansion(time, theta, phi, wires, flip):
    "This is the first order expansion (U_1)."
    qml.RX(time*theta, wires[0])
    qml.RY(time*phi, wires[1])
    if flip:
        qml.CNOT(wires=wires[:2])

  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
  def my_circuit(time, angles, num_trotter_steps):
      TrotterizedQfunc(
          time,
          *angles,
          qfunc=my_custom_first_order_expansion,
          n=num_trotter_steps,
          order=2,
          wires=['a', 'b'],
          flip=True,
      )
      return qml.state()
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> time = 0.1
  >>> angles = (0.12, -3.45)
  >>> print(qml.draw(my_circuit, level=3)(time, angles, num_trotter_steps=1))
  a: ‚îÄ‚îÄRX(0.01)‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ï≠‚óè‚îÄ‚ï≠‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄRX(0.01)‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§  State

    and normal-mode localization.
    [(#6453)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6453)
    [(#6666)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6666)
  * Implemented helper functions for calculating one-mode PES, two-mode PES, and
    three-mode PES.

  [(#6560)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6560)


<h3>Improvements üõ†</h3>

<h4>New device capabilities üíæ</h4>

* Two new methods: `setup_execution_config` and `preprocess_transforms` are added to the `Device`
  class. Device developers are encouraged to override these two methods separately instead of the
  `preprocess` method. For now, to avoid ambiguity, a device is allowed to override either these
  two methods or `preprocess`, but not both. In the long term, we will slowly phase out the use of
  `preprocess` in favour of these two methods for better separation of concerns.
  [(#6617)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6617)

* Developers of plugin devices now have the option of providing a TOML-formatted configuration file
  to declare the capabilities of the device. See [Device Capabilities](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/latest/development/plugins.html#device-capabilities) for details.

* An internal module `pennylane.devices.capabilities` is added that defines a new `DeviceCapabilites`
  data class, as well as functions that load and parse the TOML-formatted configuration files.
  [(#6407)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6407)

  ```pycon
    >>> from pennylane.devices.capabilities import DeviceCapabilities
    >>> capabilities = DeviceCapabilities.from_toml_file("my_device.toml")
    >>> isinstance(capabilities, DeviceCapabilities)
    True
  ```

* Devices that extends `qml.devices.Device` now has an optional class attribute `capabilities`
  that is an instance of the `DeviceCapabilities` data class, constructed from the configuration
  file if it exists. Otherwise, it is set to `None`.
  [(#6433)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6433)

  ```python
  from pennylane.devices import Device

  class MyDevice(Device):

      config_filepath = "path/to/config.toml"

      ...
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> isinstance(MyDevice.capabilities, DeviceCapabilities)
  True
  ```

* Default implementations of `Device.setup_execution_config` and `Device.preprocess_transforms`
  are added to the device API for devices that provides a TOML configuration file and thus have
  a `capabilities` property.
  [(#6632)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6632)
  [(#6653)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6653)

<h4>New API for Default mixed</h4>

* Added `qml.devices.qubit_mixed` module for mixed-state qubit device support [(#6379)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6379). This module introduces an `apply_operation` helper function that features:

  * Two density matrix contraction methods using `einsum` and `tensordot`
  * Optimized handling of special cases including: Diagonal operators, Identity operators, CX (controlled-X), Multi-controlled X gates, Grover operators

* Added submodule 'initialize_state' featuring a `create_initial_state` function for initializing a density matrix from `qml.StatePrep` operations or `qml.QubitDensityMatrix` operations.
  [(#6503)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6503)
  
* Added method `preprocess` to the `QubitMixed` device class to preprocess the quantum circuit before execution. Necessary non-intrusive interfaces changes to class init method were made along the way to the `QubitMixed` device class to support new API feature.
  [(#6601)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6601)

* Added a second class `DefaultMixedNewAPI` to the `qml.devices.qubit_mixed` module, which is to be the replacement of legacy `DefaultMixed` which for now to hold the implementations of `preprocess` and `execute` methods.
  [(#6607)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6607)

* Added submodule `devices.qubit_mixed.measure` as a necessary step for the new API, featuring a `measure` function for measuring qubits in mixed-state devices.
  [(#6637)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6637)

* Added submodule `devices.qubit_mixed.simulate` as a necessary step for the new API,
featuring a `simulate` function for simulating mixed states in analytic mode.
  [(#6618)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6618)

* Added submodule `devices.qubit_mixed.sampling` as a necessary step for the new API, featuring functions `sample_state`, `measure_with_samples` and `sample_probs` for sampling qubits in mixed-state devices.
  [(#6639)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6639)

* Implemented the finite-shot branch of `devices.qubit_mixed.simulate`. Now, the 
new device API of `default_mixed` should be able to take the stochastic arguments
such as `shots`, `rng` and `prng_key`.
[(#6665)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6665)

* Added support `qml.Snapshot` operation in `qml.devices.qubit_mixed.apply_operation`.
  [(#6659)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6659)

<h4>QChem improvements</h4>

* The `qml.qchem.factorize` function now supports new methods for double factorization:
  Cholesky decomposition (`cholesky=True`) and compressed double factorization (`compressed=True`).
  [(#6573)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6573)
  [(#6611)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6611)

* Added `qml.qchem.symmetry_shift` function to perform the
  [block-invariant symmetry shift](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13772) on the electronic integrals.
  [(#6574)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6574)

* Added JAX support for the differentiable Hartree-Fock workflow.
  [(#6096)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6096)
  [(#6707)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6707)

<h4>Transform for combining GlobalPhase instances</h4>

* Added a new `qml.transforms.combine_global_phases` transform to combine all `qml.GlobalPhase` gates in a circuit into a single one applied at the end.
  This can be useful for circuits that include a lot of `qml.GlobalPhase` gates, which can be introduced directly during circuit creation,
  decompositions that include `qml.GlobalPhase` gates, etc.
  [(#6686)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6686)

<h4>Better drawing functionality</h4>

* Added support for the `wire_options` dictionary to customize wire line formatting in `qml.draw_mpl` circuit
  visualizations, allowing global and per-wire customization with options like `color`, `linestyle`, and `linewidth`.
  [(#6486)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6486)

<h4>Capturing and representing hybrid programs</h4>

* Support is added for `if`/`else` statements and `for` and `while` loops in circuits executed with `qml.capture.enabled`, via Autograph.
  Autograph conversion is now used by default in `make_plxpr`, but can be skipped with the keyword arg `autograph=False`.
  [(#6406)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6406)
  [(#6413)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6413)
  [(#6426)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6426)
  [(#6645)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6645)
  [(#6685)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6685)

* `qml.transform` now accepts a `plxpr_transform` argument. This argument must be a function that can transform plxpr.
  Note that executing a transformed function will currently raise a `NotImplementedError`. To see more details, check
  out the documentation of `qml.transform`.
  [(#6633)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6633)
  [(#6722)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6722)

* Users can now apply transforms with program capture enabled. Transformed functions cannot be executed by default. To apply
  the transforms (and be able to execute the function), it must be decorated with the new `qml.capture.expand_plxpr_transforms`
  function, which accepts a callable as input and returns a new function to which all present transforms have been applied.
  [(#6722)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6722)

  ```python
  from functools import partial
  import jax

  qml.capture.enable()
  wire_map = {0: 3, 1: 6, 2: 9}

  @partial(qml.map_wires, wire_map=wire_map)
  def circuit(x, y):
      qml.RX(x, 0)
      qml.CNOT([0, 1])
      qml.CRY(y, [1, 2])
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(2))
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> qml.capture.make_plxpr(circuit)(1.2, 3.4)
  { lambda ; a:f32[] b:f32[]. let
      c:AbstractMeasurement(n_wires=None) = _map_wires_transform_transform[
      args_slice=slice(0, 2, None)
      consts_slice=slice(2, 2, None)
      inner_jaxpr={ lambda ; d:f32[] e:f32[]. let
          _:AbstractOperator() = RX[n_wires=1] d 0
          _:AbstractOperator() = CNOT[n_wires=2] 0 1
          _:AbstractOperator() = CRY[n_wires=2] e 1 2
          f:AbstractOperator() = PauliZ[n_wires=1] 2
          g:AbstractMeasurement(n_wires=None) = expval_obs f
        in (g,) }
      targs_slice=slice(2, None, None)
      tkwargs={'wire_map': {0: 3, 1: 6, 2: 9}, 'queue': False}
      ] a b
    in (c,) }
  >>> transformed_circuit = qml.capture.expand_plxpr_transforms(circuit)
  >>> jax.make_jaxpr(transformed_circuit)(1.2, 3.4)
  { lambda ; a:f32[] b:f32[]. let
      _:AbstractOperator() = RX[n_wires=1] a 3
      _:AbstractOperator() = CNOT[n_wires=2] 3 6
      _:AbstractOperator() = CRY[n_wires=2] b 6 9
      c:AbstractOperator() = PauliZ[n_wires=1] 9
      d:AbstractMeasurement(n_wires=None) = expval_obs c
    in (d,) }
  ```

* The `qml.iterative_qpe` function can now be compactly captured into jaxpr.
  [(#6680)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6680)

* Functions and plxpr can now be natively transformed using the new `qml.capture.transforms.CancelInterpreter`
  when program capture is enabled. This class cancels operators appearing consecutively that are adjoints of each
  other, and follows the same API as `qml.transforms.cancel_inverses`.
  [(#6692)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6692)

* Functions and plxpr can now be natively transformed using the new `qml.capture.transforms.DecomposeInterpreter`
  when program capture is enabled. This class decomposes pennylane operators following the same API as
  `qml.transforms.decompose`.

* Implemented a `MapWiresInterpreter` class that can be used as a quantum transform to map
  operator and measurement wires with capture enabled.
  [(#6697)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6697)

  [(#6343)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6343)

* Execution with capture enabled now follows a new execution pipeline and natively passes the
  captured jaxpr to the device. Since it no longer falls back to the old pipeline, execution
  only works with a reduced feature set.
  [(#6655)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6655)
  [(#6596)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6596)

  [(#6396)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6396)

* Added a `cartan_subalgebra` function to compute the (horizontal) Cartan subalgebra of a Cartan decomposition.
  [(#6403)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6403)
  [(#6396)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6396)

* Added a `variational_kak_adj` function to compute a KaK decomposition of a Hamiltonian given a Cartan
  decomposition and the ordered adjoint representation of the Lie algebra.
  [(#6446)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6446)

<h3>Breaking changes üíî</h3>

* The default graph coloring method of `qml.dot`, `qml.sum`, and `qml.pauli.optimize_measurements` for grouping observables was changed 
  from `"rlf"` to `"lf"`. Internally, `qml.pauli.group_observables` has been replaced with `qml.pauli.compute_partition_indices`
  in several places to improve efficiency.
  [(#6706)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6706)

* `qml.fourier.qnode_spectrum` no longer automatically converts pure numpy parameters to the
  Autograd framework. As the function uses automatic differentiation for validation, parameters
  from an autodiff framework have to be used.
  [(#6622)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6622)

* `qml.math.jax_argnums_to_tape_trainable` is moved and made private to avoid a qnode dependency
  in the math module.
  [(#6609)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6609)

* Gradient transforms are now applied after the user's transform program.
  [(#6590)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6590)

* Legacy operator arithmetic has been removed. This includes `qml.ops.Hamiltonian`, `qml.operation.Tensor`,
  `qml.operation.enable_new_opmath`, `qml.operation.disable_new_opmath`, and `qml.operation.convert_to_legacy_H`.
  Note that `qml.Hamiltonian` will continue to dispatch to `qml.ops.LinearCombination`. For more information,
  check out the [updated operator troubleshooting page](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/news/new_opmath.html).
  [(#6548)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6548)
  [(#6602)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6602)
  [(#6589)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6589)

* The developer-facing `qml.utils` module has been removed. Specifically, the
following 4 sets of functions have been either moved or removed[(#6588)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6588):

  * `qml.utils._flatten`, `qml.utils.unflatten` has been moved and renamed to `qml.optimize.qng._flatten_np` and `qml.optimize.qng._unflatten_np` respectively.

  * `qml.utils._inv_dict` and `qml._get_default_args` have been removed.

  * `qml.utils.pauli_eigs` has been moved to `qml.pauli.utils`.

  * `qml.utils.expand_vector` has been moved to `qml.math.expand_vector`.

* The `qml.qinfo` module has been removed. Please see the respective functions in the `qml.math` and `qml.measurements`
  modules instead.
  [(#6584)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6584)

* Top level access to `Device`, `QubitDevice`, and `QutritDevice` have been removed. Instead, they
  are available as `qml.devices.LegacyDevice`, `qml.devices.QubitDevice`, and `qml.devices.QutritDevice`
  respectively.
  [(#6537)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6537)

* The `'ancilla'` argument for `qml.iterative_qpe` has been removed. Instead, use the `'aux_wire'` argument.
  [(#6532)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6532)

* The `qml.BasisStatePreparation` template has been removed. Instead, use `qml.BasisState`.
  [(#6528)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6528)

* The `qml.workflow.set_shots` helper function has been removed. We no longer interact with the legacy device interface in our code.
  Instead, shots should be specified on the tape, and the device should use these shots.
  [(#6534)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6534)

* `QNode.gradient_fn` has been removed. Please use `QNode.diff_method` instead. `QNode.get_gradient_fn` can also be used to
  process the diff method.
  [(#6535)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6535)

* The `qml.QubitStateVector` template has been removed. Instead, use `qml.StatePrep`.
  [(#6525)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6525)

* `qml.broadcast` has been removed. Users should use `for` loops instead.
  [(#6527)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6527)

* The `max_expansion` argument for `qml.transforms.clifford_t_decomposition` has been removed.
  [(#6571)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6571)

* The `expand_depth` argument for `qml.compile` has been removed.
  [(#6531)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6531)

* The `qml.shadows.shadow_expval` transform has been removed. Instead, please use the
  `qml.shadow_expval` measurement process.
  [(#6530)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6530)
  [(#6561)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6561)

<h3>Deprecations üëã</h3>

* The `tape` and `qtape` properties of `QNode` have been deprecated.

  [(#6418)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6418)

* The `qml.execute` `gradient_fn` keyword argument has been renamed `diff_method`,
  to better align with the termionology used by the `QNode`.
  `gradient_fn` will be removed in v0.41.
  [(#6549)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6549)

<h3>Documentation üìù</h3>

  note that says that they are not compatible with qjit or jit.  
  [(#6702)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6702)

* Updated the documentation of `TrotterProduct` to include the impact of the operands in the
  Hamiltonian on the strucutre of the created circuit. Included an illustrative example on this.

<h3>Bug fixes üêõ</h3>

* `qml.ControlledQubitUnitary` has consistent behaviour with program capture enabled. 
  [(#6719)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6719)

* The `Wires` object throws a `TypeError` if `wires=None`. 
  [(#6713)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6713)
  [(#6720)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6720)

* The `qml.Hermitian` class no longer checks that the provided matrix is hermitian.
  The reason for this removal is to allow for faster execution and avoid incompatibilities with `jax.jit`.
  [(#6642)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6642)

* Subclasses of `qml.ops.Controlled` no longer bind the primitives of their base operators when program capture
  is enabled.
  [(#6672)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6672)

* The `qml.HilbertSchmidt` and `qml.LocalHilbertSchmidt` templates now apply the complex conjugate
  of the unitaries instead of the adjoint, providing the correct result.
  [(#6604)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6604)

* `QNode` return behaviour is now consistent for lists and tuples.
  [(#6568)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6568)

* `qml.QNode` now accepts arguments with types defined in libraries that are not necessarily
  in the list of supported interfaces, such as the `Graph` class defined in `networkx`.
  [(#6600)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6600)

* `qml.math.get_deep_interface` now works properly for autograd arrays.
  [(#6557)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6557)
