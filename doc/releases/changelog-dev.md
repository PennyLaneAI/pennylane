# Release 0.36.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Added new `SpectralNormError` class to the new error tracking functionality.
  [(#5154)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5154)
* The `dynamic_one_shot` transform is introduced enabling dynamic circuit execution on circuits with shots and devices that support `MidMeasureMP` operations natively.
  [(#5266)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5266)

* Create the `qml.Reflection` operator, useful for amplitude amplification and its variants.
  [(##5159)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5159)

  ```python
  @qml.prod
  def generator(wires):
        qml.Hadamard(wires=wires)

  U = generator(wires=0)

  dev = qml.device('default.qubit')
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():

        # Initialize to the state |1>
        qml.PauliX(wires=0)

        # Apply the reflection
        qml.Reflection(U)

        return qml.state()

  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> circuit()
  tensor([1.+6.123234e-17j, 0.-6.123234e-17j], requires_grad=True)

  ```
  
* The `qml.AmplitudeAmplification` operator is introduced, which is a high-level interface for amplitude amplification and its variants.
  [(#5160)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5160)

  ```python
  @qml.prod
  def generator(wires):
    for wire in wires:
        qml.Hadamard(wires = wire)

  U = generator(wires = range(3))
  O = qml.FlipSign(2, wires = range(3))

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():

    generator(wires = range(3))
    qml.AmplitudeAmplification(U, O, iters = 5, fixed_point=True, work_wire=3)

    return qml.probs(wires = range(3))

  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> print(np.round(circuit(),3))
  [0.009 0.009 0.94  0.009 0.009 0.009 0.009 0.009]

  ```

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>
  
* The `molecular_hamiltonian` function calls `PySCF` directly when `method='pyscf'` is selected.
  [(#5118)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5118)
  
* All generators in the source code (except those in the `qchem` module) no longer return 
  `Hamiltonian` or `Tensor` instances. Wherever possible, these return `Sum`, `SProd`, and `Prod` instances.
  [(#5253)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5253)

* Upgraded `null.qubit` to the new device API. Also, added support for all measurements and various modes of differentiation.
  [(#5211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5211)
