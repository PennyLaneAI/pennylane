# Release 0.26.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Added `QutritDevice` as an abstract base class for qutrit devices.
  [#2781](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2781)
  [#2782](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2782)

* Added operation `qml.QutritUnitary` for applying user-specified unitary operations on qutrit devices.
  [(#2699)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2699)

* Added `default.qutrit` plugin for pure state simulation of qutrits. Currently supports operation `qml.QutritUnitary` and measurements `qml.state()`, `qml.probs()`.
  [(#2783)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2783)

  ```pycon
  >>> dev = qml.device("default.qutrit", wires=1)
  >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
  ... def circuit(U):
  ...     qml.QutritUnitary(U, wires=0)
  ...     return qml.probs(wires=0)
  >>> U = np.array([[1, 1, 0], [1, -1, 0], [0, 0, np.sqrt(2)]]) / np.sqrt(2)
  >>> print(circuit(U))
  [0.5 0.5 0. ]
  ```

* Added `qml.THermitian` observable for measuring user-specified Hermitian matrix observables for qutrit circuits.
  ([#2784](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2784))

* Added the `qml.TShift` and `qml.TClock` qutrit operations for qutrit devices, which are the qutrit analogs of the Pauli X and Pauli Z operations.
  ([#2841](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2841))
  * Added `qml.TAdd` operation for qutrit devices, which is the generalized analog of the CX operation.
  ([#2842](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2842))
  * Added `qml.TSWAP` operation for qutrit devices, which swaps the state between two wires.
  ([#2843](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2843))
  * Added `qml.ControlledQutritUnitary` operation for qutrit devices, which allows users to apply a controlled arbitrary unitary operation.
  ([#2844](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2844))
  * Added `TRX()` operation, which applies an X rotation to a subspace specified by the user. The subspace determines which 2 of 3 one-qutrit basis states the operation applies to. Updated `pennylane/qnode.py` to support parameter shift differentiation on qutrit devices.
  ([#2845](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2845))
  * Added `TRY()` operation, which applies an Y rotation to a subspace specified by the user. The subspace determines which 2 of 3 one-qutrit basis states the operation applies to.
  ([#2846](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2846))
  * Added `TRZ()` operation, which applies an Z rotation to a subspace specified by the user. The subspace determines which 2 of 3 one-qutrit basis states the operation applies to.
  ([#2847](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2847))

**Classical shadows**

* Added the `qml.classical_shadow` measurement process that can now be returned from QNodes.

  The measurement protocol is described in detail in the
  [classical shadows paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08953). Calling the QNode
  will return the randomized Pauli measurements (the `recipes`) that are performed
  for each qubit, identified as a unique integer:

  - 0 for Pauli X
  - 1 for Pauli Y
  - 2 for Pauli Z

  It also returns the measurement results (the `bits`), which is `0` if the 1 eigenvalue
  is sampled, and `1` if the -1 eigenvalue is sampled.

  For example,

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2, shots=5)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      return qml.classical_shadow(wires=[0, 1])
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> bits, recipes = circuit()
  tensor([[0, 0],
          [1, 0],
          [1, 0],
          [0, 0],
          [0, 1]], dtype=uint8, requires_grad=True)
  >>> recipes
  tensor([[2, 2],
          [0, 2],
          [1, 0],
          [0, 2],
          [0, 2]], dtype=uint8, requires_grad=True)
  ```

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Automatic circuit cutting is improved by making better partition imbalance derivations.
  Now it is more likely to generate optimal cuts for larger circuits.
  [(#2517)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2517)

* The `qml.simplify` method now can compute the adjoint and power of specific operators.
  [(#2922)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2922)

  ```pycon
  >>> adj_op = qml.adjoint(qml.RX(1, 0))
  >>> qml.simplify(adj_op)
  RX(-1, wires=[0])
  ```

* `qml.operation.expand_matrix` now supports qutrit matrices such that `Operator.matrix` is now able to permute and
  expand qutrit matrices according to the given wire order.

  ```pycon
  >>> op = qml.TShift(wires=0)
  >>> op.matrix(wire_order=[0, 1])
  array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
         [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]])
    ```
