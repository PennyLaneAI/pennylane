  [(#6167)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6167)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* `expand_fn`, `max_expansion`, `override_shots`, and `device_batch_transform` are removed from the
  signature of `qml.execute`.
  [(#6203)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6203)

* `max_expansion` and `expansion_strategy` are removed from the `QNode`.
  [(#6203)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6203)

* `expansion_strategy` is removed from `qml.draw`, `qml.draw_mpl`, and `qml.specs`. `max_expansion` is removed from `qml.specs`, as it had no impact on the output.
  [(#6203)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6203)

* `qml.transforms.hamiltonian_expand` and `qml.transforms.sum_expand` are removed.
