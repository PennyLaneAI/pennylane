# Release 0.40.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

<h4>Other Improvements</h4>

* Added `qml.devices.qubit_mixed` module for mixed-state qubit device support. This module introduces:

  [(#6379)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6379) An `apply_operation` helper function featuring:

  * Two density matrix contraction methods using `einsum` and `tensordot`

  * Optimized handling of special cases including: Diagonal operators, Identity operators, CX (controlled-X), Multi-controlled X gates, Grover operators

* `qml.BasisRotation` template is now JIT compatible.
  [(#6019)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6019)

* Expand `ExecutionConfig.gradient_method` to store `TransformDispatcher` type.
  [(#6455)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6455)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* Top level access to `Device`, `QubitDevice`, and `QutritDevice` have been removed. Instead, they
  are available as `qml.devices.LegacyDevice`, `qml.devices.QubitDevice`, and `qml.devices.QutritDevice`
  respectively.
