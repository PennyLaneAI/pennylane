# Release 0.42.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* A new template called :class:`~.SelectPauliRot` that applies a sequence of uniformly controlled rotations to a target qubit 
  is now available. This operator appears frequently in unitary decomposition and block encoding techniques. 
  [(#7206)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7206)

  ```python
  angles = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])

  wires = qml.registers({"control": 2, "target": 1})
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.SelectPauliRot(
        angles,
        control_wires=wires["control"],
        target_wire=wires["target"],
        rot_axis="Y")
      return qml.state()
  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> print(circuit())
  [0.87758256+0.j 0.47942554+0.j 0.        +0.j 0.        +0.j
   0.        +0.j 0.        +0.j 0.        +0.j 0.        +0.j]
  ```
  

* The transform `convert_to_mbqc_gateset` is added to the `ftqc` module to convert arbitrary 
  circuits to a limited gate-set that can be translated to the MBQC formalism.
  [(7271)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7271)

* The `RotXZX` operation is added to the `ftqc` module to support definition of a universal
  gate-set that can be translated to the MBQC formalism.
  [(7271)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7271)

* Two new functions called :func:`~.math.convert_to_su2` and :func:`~.math.convert_to_su4` have been added to `qml.math`, which convert unitary matrices to SU(2) or SU(4), respectively, and optionally a global phase.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

<h4>Resource-efficient Decompositions 🔎</h4>

* New decomposition rules comprising rotation gates and global phases have been added to `QubitUnitary` that 
  can be accessed with the new graph-based decomposition system. The most efficient set of rotations to 
  decompose into will be chosen based on the target gate set.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

  ```python
  from functools import partial
  import numpy as np
  import pennylane as qml
  
  qml.decomposition.enable_graph()
  
  U = np.array([[1, 1], [1, -1]]) / np.sqrt(2)
  
  @partial(qml.transforms.decompose, gate_set={"RX", "RY", "GlobalPhase"})
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
  def circuit():
      qml.QubitUnitary(np.array([[1, 1], [1, -1]]) / np.sqrt(2), wires=[0])
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())
  0: ──RX(0.00)──RY(1.57)──RX(3.14)──GlobalPhase(-1.57)─┤  <Z>
  ```

* Decomposition rules can be marked as not-applicable with :class:`~.decomposition.DecompositionNotApplicable`, allowing for flexibility when creating conditional decomposition 
  rules based on parameters that affects the rule's resources.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  from pennylane.decomposition import DecompositionNotApplicable
  from pennylane.math.decomposition import zyz_rotation_angles
  
  def _zyz_resource(num_wires):
      if num_wires != 1:
          # This decomposition is only applicable when num_wires is 1
          raise DecompositionNotApplicable
      return {qml.RZ: 2, qml.RY: 1, qml.GlobalPhase: 1}

  @qml.register_resources(_zyz_resource)
  def zyz_decomposition(U, wires, **__):
      phi, theta, omega, phase = zyz_rotation_angles(U, return_global_phase=True)
      qml.RZ(phi, wires=wires[0])
      qml.RY(theta, wires=wires[0])
      qml.RZ(omega, wires=wires[0])
      qml.GlobalPhase(-phase)
  
  qml.add_decomps(QubitUnitary, zyz_decomposition)
  ```
  
  This decomposition will be ignored for `QubitUnitary` on more than one wire.

* The :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform now supports symbolic operators (e.g., `Adjoint` and `Controlled`) specified as strings in the `gate_set` argument
  when the new graph-based decomposition system is enabled.
  [(#7331)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7331)

  ```python
  from functools import partial
  import pennylane as qml
  
  qml.decomposition.enable_graph()
   
  @partial(qml.transforms.decompose, gate_set={"T", "Adjoint(T)", "H", "CNOT"})
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
  def circuit():
      qml.Toffoli(wires=[0, 1, 2])
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())
  0: ───────────╭●───────────╭●────╭●──T──╭●─┤  
  1: ────╭●─────│─────╭●─────│───T─╰X──T†─╰X─┤  
  2: ──H─╰X──T†─╰X──T─╰X──T†─╰X──T──H────────┤
  ```

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

* The :func:`~.transforms.cancel_inverses` transform no longer changes the order of operations that don't have shared wires, providing a deterministic output.
  [(#7328)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7328)

* Alias for Identity (`I`) is now accessible from `qml.ops`.
  [(#7200)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7200)

* `Operator.num_wires` now defaults to `None` to indicate that the operator can be on
  any number of wires.
  [(#7312)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7312)

* Shots can now be overridden for specific `qml.Snapshot` instances via a `shots` keyword argument.
  [(#7326)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7326)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2, shots=10)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.Snapshot("sample", measurement=qml.sample(qml.X(0)), shots=5)
      return qml.sample(qml.X(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.snapshots(circuit)()
  {'sample': array([-1., -1., -1., -1., -1.]),
   'execution_results': array([ 1., -1., -1., -1., -1.,  1., -1., -1.,  1., -1.])}
  ```

* Two-qubit `QubitUnitary` gates no longer decompose into fundamental rotation gates; it now 
  decomposes into single-qubit `QubitUnitary` gates. This allows the decomposition system to
  further decompose single-qubit unitary gates more flexibly using different rotations.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

* The `gate_set` argument of :func:`~.transforms.decompose` now accepts `"X"`, `"Y"`, `"Z"`, `"H"`, 
  `"I"` as aliases for `"PauliX"`, `"PauliY"`, `"PauliZ"`, `"Hadamard"`, and `"Identity"`. These 
  aliases are also recognized as part of symbolic operators. For example, `"Adjoint(H)"` is now 
  accepted as an alias for `"Adjoint(Hadamard)"`.
  [(#7331)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7331)

* PennyLane no longer validates that an operation has at least one wire, as having this check required the abstract
  interface to maintain a list of special implementations.
  [(#7327)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7327)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* The `return_type` property of `MeasurementProcess` has been removed. Please use `isinstance` for type checking instead.
  [(#7322)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7322)

* The `KerasLayer` class in `qml.qnn.keras` has been removed because Keras 2 is no longer actively maintained.
  Please consider using a different machine learning framework, like :doc:`PyTorch <demos/tutorial_qnn_module_torch>` or :doc:`JAX <demos/tutorial_How_to_optimize_QML_model_using_JAX_and_Optax>`.
  [(#7320)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7320)

* The `qml.gradients.hamiltonian_grad` function has been removed because this gradient recipe is no
  longer required with the :doc:`new operator arithmetic system </news/new_opmath>`.
  [(#7302)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7302)

* Accessing terms of a tensor product (e.g., `op = X(0) @ X(1)`) via `op.obs` has been removed.
  [(#7324)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7324)

* The `mcm_method` keyword argument in `qml.execute` has been removed.
  [(#7301)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7301)

* The `inner_transform` and `config` keyword arguments in `qml.execute` have been removed.
  [(#7300)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7300)

* `Sum.ops`, `Sum.coeffs`, `Prod.ops` and `Prod.coeffs` have been removed.
  [(#7304)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7304)

* Specifying `pipeline=None` with `qml.compile` has been removed.
  [(#7307)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7307)

* The `control_wires` argument in `qml.ControlledQubitUnitary` has been removed.
  Furthermore, the `ControlledQubitUnitary` no longer accepts `QubitUnitary` objects as arguments as its `base`.
  [(#7305)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7305)

* `qml.tape.TapeError` has been removed.
  [(#7205)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7205)

<h3>Deprecations 👋</h3>

* `qml.operation.WiresEnum`, `qml.operation.AllWires`, and `qml.operation.AnyWires` are deprecated. To indicate that
  an operator can act on any number of wires, `Operator.num_wires = None` should be used instead. This is the default
  and does not need to be overwritten unless the operator developer wants to add wire number validation.
  [(#7313)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7313)

* The :func:`qml.QNode.get_gradient_fn` method is now deprecated. Instead, use :func:`~.workflow.get_best_diff_method` to obtain the differentiation method.
  [(#7323)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7323)

<h3>Internal changes ⚙️</h3>

* A new internal module, `qml.concurrency`, is added to support internal use of multiprocess and multithreaded execution of workloads. This also migrates the use of `concurrent.futures` in `default.qubit` to this new design.
  [(#7303)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7303)

* Test suites in `tests/transforms/test_defer_measurement.py` use analytic mocker devices to test numeric results.
  [(#7329)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7329)

* Introduce module dependency management using `tach`.
  [(#7185)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7185)

* Add new `pennylane.exceptions` module for custom errors and warnings.
  [(#7205)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7205)

* Clean up `__init__.py` files in `math`, `ops`, `qaoa`, `tape` and `templates` to be explicit in what they import. 
  [(#7200)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7200)
  
* The `Tracker` class has been moved into the `devices` module.
  [(#7281)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7281)

* Moved functions that calculate rotation angles for unitary decompositions into an internal
  module `qml.math.decomposition`
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

<h3>Documentation 📝</h3>

* The entry in the :doc:`/news/program_capture_sharp_bits` page for using program capture with Catalyst
  has been updated. Instead of using ``qjit(experimental_capture=True)``, Catalyst is now compatible 
  with the global toggles ``qml.capture.enable()`` and ``qml.capture.disable()`` for enabling and 
  disabling program capture.
  [(#7298)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7298)

<h3>Bug fixes 🐛</h3>

* A fix was made to `default.qubit` to allow for using `qml.Snapshot` with defer-measurements (`mcm_method="deferred"`).
  [(#7335)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7335)

* Fixes the repr for empty `Prod` and `Sum` instances to better communicate the existence of an empty instance.
  [(#7346)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7346)

* Fixes a bug where circuit execution fails with ``BlockEncode`` initialized with sparse matrices.
  [(#7285)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7285)

* Adds an informative error if `qml.cond` is used with an abstract condition with
  jitting on `default.qubit` if capture is enabled.
  [(#7314)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7314)

* Fixes a bug where using a ``StatePrep`` operation with `batch_size=1` did not work with ``default.mixed``.
  [(#7280)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7280)

* Gradient transforms can now be used in conjunction with batch transforms with all interfaces.
  [(#7287)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7287)

* Fixes a bug where the global phase was not being added in the ``QubitUnitary`` decomposition.  
  [(#7244)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7244)
  [(#7270)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7270)

* Using finite differences with program capture without x64 mode enabled now raises a warning.
  [(#7282)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7282)

* When the `mcm_method` is specified to the `"device"`, the `defer_measurements` transform will 
  no longer be applied. Instead, the device will be responsible for all MCM handling.
  [(#7243)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7243)

* Fixed coverage of `qml.liealg.CII` and `qml.liealg.AIII`.
  [(#7291)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7291)

* Fixed a bug where the phase is used as the wire label for a `qml.GlobalPhase` when capture is enabled.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

* Fixed a bug that caused `CountsMP.process_counts` to return results in the computational basis, even if
  an observable was specified.
  [(#7342)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7342)

* Fixed a bug that caused `SamplesMP.process_counts` used with an observable to return a list of eigenvalues 
  for each individual operation in the observable, instead of the overall result.
  [(#7342)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7342)

* Fixed a bug where `two_qubit_decomposition` provides an incorrect decomposition for some special matrices.
  [(#7340)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7340)
