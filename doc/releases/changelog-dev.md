# Release 0.32.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* `DefaultQubit2` accepts a `max_workers` argument which controls multiprocessing. 
  A `ProcessPoolExecutor` executes tapes asynchronously
  using a pool of at most `max_workers` processes. If `max_workers` is `None`
  or not given, only the current process executes tapes. If you experience any
  issue, say using JAX, TensorFlow, Torch, try setting `max_workers` to `None`.
  [(#4319)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4319)
  [(#4425)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4425)

* Transform Programs are now integrated with the `QNode`.
  [(#4404)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4404)

```
def null_postprocessing(results: qml.typing.ResultBatch) -> qml.typing.Result:
    return results[0]

@qml.transforms.core.transform
def scale_shots(tape: qml.tape.QuantumTape, shot_scaling) -> (Tuple[qml.tape.QuantumTape], Callable):
    new_shots = tape.shots.total_shots * shot_scaling
    new_tape = qml.tape.QuantumScript(tape.operations, tape.measurements, shots=new_shots)
    return (new_tape, ), null_postprocessing

dev = qml.devices.experimental.DefaultQubit2()

@partial(scale_shots, shot_scaling=2)
@qml.qnode(dev, interface=None)
def circuit():
    return qml.sample(wires=0)

```

>>> circuit(shots=1)
array([False, False])

* Functions are available to obtain a state vector from `PySCF` solver objects.
  [(#4427)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4427)
  [(#4433)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4433)

  The `qml.qchem.import_state` function can be used to import a `PySCF` solver object and return the
  corresponding state vector.

  ```pycon
  >>> from pyscf import gto, scf, ci
  >>> mol = gto.M(atom=[['H', (0, 0, 0)], ['H', (0,0,0.71)]], basis='sto6g')
  >>> myhf = scf.UHF(mol).run()
  >>> myci = ci.UCISD(myhf).run()
  >>> wf_cisd = qml.qchem.import_state(myci, tol=1e-1)
  >>> print(wf_cisd)
  [ 0.        +0.j  0.        +0.j  0.        +0.j  0.1066467 +0.j
    0.        +0.j  0.        +0.j  0.        +0.j  0.        +0.j
    0.        +0.j  0.        +0.j  0.        +0.j  0.        +0.j
   -0.99429698+0.j  0.        +0.j  0.        +0.j  0.        +0.j]
  ```

  The currently supported objects are RCISD, UCISD, RCCSD, and UCCSD which correspond to 
  restricted (R) and unrestricted (U) configuration interaction (CI )and coupled cluster (CC) 
  calculations with single and double (SD) excitations.

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

* Transform Programs, `qml.transforms.core.TransformProgram`, can now be called on a batch of circuits
  and return a new batch of circuits and a single post processing function.
  [(#4364)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4364)

* `HardwareHamiltonian`s can now be summed with `int` or `float`.
  A sequence of `HardwareHamiltonian`s can now be summed via the builtin `sum`.
  [(#4343)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4343)

* All `Operator` objects now define `Operator._flatten` and `Operator._unflatten` methods that separate
  trainable from untrainable components. These methods will be used in serialization and pytree registration.
  Custom operations may need an update to ensure compatibility with new PennyLane features.
  [(#4314)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4314)

* Treat auxiliary wires and device wires in the same way in `transforms.metric_tensor`
  as in `gradients.hadamard_grad`. Support all valid wire input formats for `aux_wire`.
  [(#4328)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4328)

* `qml.equal` no longer raises errors when operators or measurements of different types are compared.
  Instead, it returns `False`.
  [(#4315)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4315)

* The `qml.gradients` module no longer mutates operators in-place for any gradient transforms.
  Instead, operators that need to be mutated are copied with new parameters.
  [(#4220)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4220)

* `PauliWord` sparse matrices are much faster, which directly improves `PauliSentence`.
  [(#4272)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4272)

* Enable linting of all tests in CI and the pre-commit hook.
  [(#4335)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4335)

* Added a function `qml.math.fidelity_statevector` that computes the fidelity between two state vectors.
  [(#4322)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4322)

* The `qchem` module is upgraded to use the fermionic operators of the `fermi` module.
  [#4336](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4336)

* QNode transforms in `qml.qinfo` now support custom wire labels.
  [#4331](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4331)

* The `qchem` functions `primitive_norm` and `contracted_norm` are modified to be compatible with
  higher versions of scipy. The private function `_fac2` for computing double factorials is added. 
  [#4321](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4321)

* The default label for a `StatePrep` operator is now `|Ψ⟩`.
  [(#4340)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4340)

* The experimental device interface is integrated with the `QNode` for jax, jax-jit, tensorflow and torch.
  [(#4323)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4323)
  [(#4352)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4352)
  [(#4392)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4392)
  [(#4393)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4393)

* `tape_expand` now uses `Operator.decomposition` instead of `Operator.expand` in order to make
  more performant choices.
  [(#4355)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4355)

* The `QuantumScript` class now has a `bind_new_parameters` method that allows creation of
  new `QuantumScript` objects with the provided parameters.
  [(#4345)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4345)

* `qml.ctrl(qml.PauliX)` returns a `CNOT`, `Toffoli` or `MultiControlledX` instead of a `Controlled(PauliX)`.
  [(#4339)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4339)

* Added functions `adjoint_jvp` and `adjoint_vjp` to `qml.devices.qubit.adjoint_jacobian` that computes
  the JVP and VJP of a tape using the adjoint method.
  [(#4358)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4358)

* Readability improvements and stylistic changes to `pennylane/interfaces/jax_jit_tuple.py`
  [(#4379)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4379/)

* When given a callable, `qml.ctrl` now does its custom pre-processing on all queued operators from the callable.
  [(#4370)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4370)

* `qml.interfaces.set_shots` accepts `Shots` object as well as `int`'s and tuples of `int`'s.
  [(#4388)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4388)

* `pennylane.devices.experimental.Device` now accepts a shots keyword argument and has a `shots`
  property. This property is merely used to set defaults for a workflow, and does not directly
  influence the number of shots used in executions or derivatives.
  [(#4388)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4388)

* PennyLane no longer directly relies on `Operator.__eq__`.
  [(#4398)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4398)

* If no seed is specified on initialization with `DefaultQubit2`, the local random number generator will be
  seeded from on the NumPy's global random number generator.
  [(#4394)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4394)

* The experimental `DefaultQubit2` device now supports computing VJPs and JVPs using the adjoint method.
  [(#4374)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4374)

  [(#4437)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4437)

* Updated `expand_fn()` for `DefaultQubit2` to decompose `StatePrep` operations present in the middle of a circuit.
  [(#4444)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4444)

* `transmon_drive` is updated in accordance with [1904.06560](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06560). In particular, the functional form has been changed from $\Omega(t)(\cos(\omega_d t + \phi) X - \sin(\omega_d t + \phi) Y)$ to $\Omega(t) \sin(\omega_d t + \phi) Y$.
  [(#4418)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4418/)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* `MeasurementValue`'s signature has been updated to accept a list of `MidMeasureMP`'s rather than a list of
  their IDs.
  [(#4446)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4446)

* `Operator.expand` now uses the output of `Operator.decomposition` instead of what it queues.
  [(#4355)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4355)

* The `do_queue` keyword argument in `qml.operation.Operator` has been removed. Instead of
  setting `do_queue=False`, use the `qml.QueuingManager.stop_recording()` context.
  [(#4317)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4317)

* The `grouping_type` and `grouping_method` keyword arguments are removed from `qchem.molecular_hamiltonian`.

  these quantities can be accessed as fields of the new ``Resources`` object saved under
  ``specs_dict["resources"]``:

  - ``num_operations`` is no longer supported, use ``specs_dict["resources"].num_gates``
  - ``num_used_wires`` is no longer supported, use ``specs_dict["resources"].num_wires``
  - ``gate_types`` is no longer supported, use ``specs_dict["resources"].gate_types``
  - ``gate_sizes`` is no longer supported, use ``specs_dict["resources"].gate_sizes``
  - ``depth`` is no longer supported, use ``specs_dict["resources"].depth``

* `qml.math.purity`, `qml.math.vn_entropy`, `qml.math.mutual_info`, `qml.math.fidelity`,
  `qml.math.relative_entropy`, and `qml.math.max_entropy` no longer support state vectors as
  input.
  [(#4322)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4322)

* The Pauli-X-term in `transmon_drive` has been removed in accordance with [1904.06560](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06560)
  [(#4418)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4418/)

<h3>Deprecations 👋</h3>

* ``qml.qchem.jordan_wigner`` is deprecated, use ``qml.jordan_wigner`` instead. 
  List input to define the fermionic operator is also deprecated; the fermionic 
  operators in the ``qml.fermi`` module should be used instead.
  [(#4332)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4332)

* The `qml.RandomLayers.compute_decomposition` keyword argument `ratio_imprimitive` will be changed to `ratio_imprim` to
  match the call signature of the operation.
  [(#4314)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4314)

* The CV observables ``qml.X`` and ``qml.P`` have been deprecated. Use ``qml.QuadX`` 
  and ``qml.QuadP`` instead.
  [(#4330)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4330)

* The method ``tape.unwrap()`` and corresponding ``UnwrapTape`` and ``Unwrap`` classes 
  are deprecated. Use ``convert_to_numpy_parameters`` instead.
  [(#4344)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4344)

* `qml.enable_return` and `qml.disable_return` are deprecated. Please avoid calling
  `disable_return`, as the old return system is deprecated along with these switch functions.
  [(#4316)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4316)

* The `mode` keyword argument in `QNode` is deprecated, as it was only used in the
  old return system (which is also deprecated). Please use `grad_on_execution` instead.
  [(#4316)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4316)

* The `QuantumScript.set_parameters` method and the `QuantumScript.data` setter has
  been deprecated. Please use `QuantumScript.bind_new_parameters` instead.

  between instances of `qml.GellMann`, as well as Hamiltonians and Tensors
  containing `qml.GellMann`.
  [(#4366)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4366)

* `qml.transforms.merge_amplitude_embedding` now works correctly when the `AmplitudeEmbedding`s
  have a batch dimension.
  [(#4353)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4353)

* The `jordan_wigner` function is modified to work with Hamiltonians built with an active space.
  [(#4372)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4372)

  `qml.drawer.use_style` instead of `black_white`.
  [(#4357)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4357)

* `qml.devices.qubit.preprocess.validate_and_expand_adjoint` no longer sets the
  trainable parameters of the expanded tape.
  [(#4365)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4365)

* `qml.default_expand_fn` now selectively expands operations or measurements allowing more 
  operations to be executed in circuits when measuring non-qwc Hamiltonians.
  [(#4401)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4401)

* `qml.ControlledQubitUnitary` no longer reports `has_decomposition` as `True` when it does
  not really have a decomposition.
  [(#4407)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4407)

* `qml.transforms.split_non_commuting` now correctly works on tapes containing both `expval`
  and `var` measurements.
  [(#4426)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4426)

* Subtracting a `Prod` from another operator now works as expected.
  [(#4441)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4441)
