# Release 0.21.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* A tensor network template has been added. Quantum circuits with the shape of a matrix product state tensor network can now be easily implemented. Motivation and theory can be found in [arXiv:1803.11537](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11537). [(#1871)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1871)

  An example circuit that uses the `MPS` template is:
  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  import numpy as np

  def block(weights, wires):
      qml.CNOT(wires=[wires[0],wires[1]])
      qml.RY(weights[0], wires=wires[0])
      qml.RY(weights[1], wires=wires[1])

  n_wires = 4
  n_block_wires = 2
  n_params_block = 2
  template_weights = [[0.1,-0.3],[0.4,0.2],[-0.15,0.5]]

  dev= qml.device('default.qubit',wires=range(n_wires))
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(weights):
      qml.MPS(range(n_wires),n_block_wires,block, n_params_block, weights)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=n_wires-1))
  ```

  The resulting circuit is:
  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit,expansion_strategy='device')(template_weights))
  0: ──╭C──RY(0.1)───────────────────────────────┤
  1: ──╰X──RY(-0.3)──╭C──RY(0.4)─────────────────┤
  2: ────────────────╰X──RY(0.2)──╭C──RY(-0.15)──┤
  3: ─────────────────────────────╰X──RY(0.5)────┤ ⟨Z⟩
  ```

* Added the adjoint method for the metric tensor.
  [(#1992)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1992)

  This method, detailed in [Jones 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02991),
  computes the metric tensor using four copies of the state vector and
  a number of operations that scales quadratically in the number of trainable
  parameters (see below for details).
  
  Note that as it makes use of state cloning, it is inherently classical
  and can only be used with statevector simulators and `shots=None`.

  It is particular useful for larger circuits for which backpropagation requires
  inconvenient or even unfeasible amounts of storage, but is slower.
  Furthermore, the adjoint method is only available for analytic computation, not
  for measurements simulation with `shots!=None`.

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)
  
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x, y):
      qml.Rot(*x[0], wires=0)
      qml.Rot(*x[1], wires=1)
      qml.Rot(*x[2], wires=2)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 2])
      qml.CNOT(wires=[2, 0])
      qml.RY(y[0], wires=0)
      qml.RY(y[1], wires=1)
      qml.RY(y[0], wires=2)

  x = np.array([[0.2, 0.4, -0.1], [-2.1, 0.5, -0.2], [0.1, 0.7, -0.6]], requires_grad=False)
  y = np.array([1.3, 0.2], requires_grad=True)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.adjoint_metric_tensor(circuit)(x, y)
  tensor([[ 0.25495723, -0.07086695],
          [-0.07086695,  0.24945606]], requires_grad=True)
  ```

  Computational cost

  The adjoint method uses :math:`2P^2+4P+1` gates and state cloning operations if the circuit
  is composed only of trainable gates, where :math:`P` is the number of trainable operations.
  If non-trainable gates are included, each of them is applied about :math:`n^2-n` times, where
  :math:`n` is the number of trainable operations that follow after the respective 
  non-trainable operation in the circuit. This means that non-trainable gates later in the 
  circuit are executed less often, making the adjoint method a bit cheaper if such gates
  appear later.
  The adjoint method requires memory for 4 independent state vectors, which corresponds roughly
  to storing a state vector of a system with 2 additional qubits.

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Interferometer is now a class with `shape` method.
  [(#1946)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1946)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fixes a bug where PennyLane didn't require v0.20.0 of PennyLane-Lightning,
  but raised an error with versions of Lightning earlier than v0.20.0 due to
  the new batch execution pipeline.
  [(#2033)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2033)

* Fixes a bug in `classical_jacobian` when used with Torch, where the
  Jacobian of the preprocessing was also computed for non-trainable
  parameters.
  [(#2020)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2020)

* Fixes a bug in queueing of the `two_qubit_decomposition` method that
  originally led to circuits with >3 two-qubit unitaries failing when passed
  through the `unitary_to_rot` optimization transform.
  [(#2015)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2015)

<h3>Documentation</h3>

* Extended the interfaces description page to explicitly mention device
  compatibility.
  [(#2031)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2031)
