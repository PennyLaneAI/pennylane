# Release 0.40.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* A `DeviceCapabilities` data class is defined to contain all capabilities of the device's execution interface (i.e. its implementation of `Device.execute`). A TOML file can be used to define the capabilities of a device, and it can be loaded into a `DeviceCapabilities` object.
  [(#6407)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6407)

  ```pycon
  >>> from pennylane.devices.capabilities import load_toml_file, parse_toml_document, DeviceCapabilities
  >>> document = load_toml_file("my_device.toml")
  >>> capabilities = parse_toml_document(document)
  >>> isinstance(capabilities, DeviceCapabilities)
  True
  ```

<h4>New API for Qubit Mixed</h4>

* Added `qml.devices.qubit_mixed` module for mixed-state qubit device support. [(#6379)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6379) 
  This module introduces an `apply_operation` helper function that features:

  * Two density matrix contraction methods using `einsum` and `tensordot`

  * Optimized handling of special cases including: Diagonal operators, Identity operators, CX (controlled-X), Multi-controlled X gates, Grover operators

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

<h4>Other Improvements</h4>

* `qml.BasisRotation` template is now JIT compatible.
  [(#6019)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6019)

* Expand `ExecutionConfig.gradient_method` to store `TransformDispatcher` type.
  [(#6455)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6455)
