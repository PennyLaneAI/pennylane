# Release 0.27.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Added the `qml.GellMann` qutrit observable, which is the ternary generalization of the Pauli observables. Users must include an index as a
keyword argument when using `GellMann`, which determines which of the 8 Gell-Mann matrices is used as the observable.
