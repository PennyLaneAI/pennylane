# Release 0.21.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* The `RotosolveOptimizer` has been generalized to arbitrary frequency spectra
  in the cost function. Also note the changes in behaviour listed under *Breaking
  changes*.
  [(#2081)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2081)

  Previously, the `RotsolveOptimizer` was available for cost functions with
  frequency spectra that only contained integers, and the maximal frequency
  (instead of the number of frequencies) determined the cost of the optimization.
  Now arbitrary frequencies are supported.

  Consider the QNode
  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def qnode(x, Y):
      qml.RX(2.5 * x, wires=0)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      qml.RZ(0.3 * Y[0], wires=0)
      qml.CRY(1.1 * Y[1], wires=[1, 0])
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1))

  x = np.array(0.8, requires_grad=True)
  Y = np.array([-0.2, 1.5], requires_grad=True)
  ```

  Its frequency spectra can be easily obtained via `qml.fourier.qnode_spectrum`:
  ```pycon
  >>> spectra = qml.fourier.qnode_spectrum(qnode)(x, Y)
  >>> spectra
  {'x': {(): [-2.5, 0.0, 2.5]},
   'Y': {(0,): [-0.3, 0.0, 0.3], (1,): [-1.1, -0.55, 0.0, 0.55, 1.1]}}
  ```

  We may then initialize the `RotosolveOptimizer` and minimize the QNode cost function
  by providing this information about the frequency spectra. We also compare the cost at
  each step to the initial cost.
  ```pycon
  >>> cost_init = qnode(x, Y)
  >>> opt = qml.RotosolveOptimizer()
  >>> for _ in range(2):
  ...     x, Y = opt.step(qnode, x, Y, spectra=spectra)
  ...     print(f"New cost: {np.round(qnode(x, Y), 3)}; Initial cost: {np.round(cost_init, 3)}")
  New cost: 0.0; Initial cost: 0.706
  New cost: -1.0; Initial cost: 0.706
  ```

  The optimization with `RotosolveOptimizer` is performed in substeps. The minimal cost
  of these substeps can be retrieved by setting `full_output=True`.
  ```pycon
  >>> x = np.array(0.8, requires_grad=True)
  >>> Y = np.array([-0.2, 1.5], requires_grad=True)
  >>> opt = qml.RotosolveOptimizer()
  >>> for _ in range(2):
  ...     (x, Y), history = opt.step(qnode, x, Y, spectra=spectra, full_output=True)
  ...     print(f"New cost: {np.round(qnode(x, Y), 3)} reached via substeps {np.round(history, 3)}")
  New cost: 0.0 reached via substeps [-0.  0.  0.]
  New cost: -1.0 reached via substeps [-0.276 -0.276 -1.   ]
  ```
  However, note that these intermediate minimal values are evaluations of the
  *reconstructions* that Rotosolve creates and uses internally for the optimization,
  and not of the original objective function. For noisy cost functions, these intermediate
  evaluations may differ significantly from evaluations of the original cost function.

* A tensor network templates module has been added. Quantum circuits with the shape
  of a matrix product state tensor network can now be easily implemented.
  Motivation and theory can be found in [arXiv:1803.11537](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11537).
  [(#1871)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1871)

  An example circuit that uses the `MPS` template is:
  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  import numpy as np

  def block(weights, wires):
      qml.CNOT(wires=[wires[0],wires[1]])
      qml.RY(weights[0], wires=wires[0])
      qml.RY(weights[1], wires=wires[1])

  n_wires = 4
  n_block_wires = 2
  n_params_block = 2
  template_weights = [[0.1,-0.3],[0.4,0.2],[-0.15,0.5]]

  dev= qml.device('default.qubit',wires=range(n_wires))
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(weights):
      qml.MPS(range(n_wires),n_block_wires,block, n_params_block, weights)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=n_wires-1))
  ```

  The resulting circuit is:
  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit,expansion_strategy='device')(template_weights))
  0: ──╭C──RY(0.1)───────────────────────────────┤
  1: ──╰X──RY(-0.3)──╭C──RY(0.4)─────────────────┤
  2: ────────────────╰X──RY(0.2)──╭C──RY(-0.15)──┤
  3: ─────────────────────────────╰X──RY(0.5)────┤ ⟨Z⟩
  ```
* Added a template for tree tensor networks (TTN).
  [(#2043)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2043)
  An example circuit that uses the `TTN` template is:
  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  import numpy as np

  def block(weights, wires):
      qml.CNOT(wires=[wires[0],wires[1]])
      qml.RY(weights[0], wires=wires[0])
      qml.RY(weights[1], wires=wires[1])

  n_wires = 4
  n_block_wires = 2
  n_params_block = 2
  n_blocks = qml.MPS.get_n_blocks(range(n_wires),n_block_wires)
  template_weights = [[0.1,-0.3]]*n_blocks

  dev= qml.device('default.qubit',wires=range(n_wires))
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(template_weights):
      qml.TTN(range(n_wires), n_block_wires, block, n_params_block, template_weights)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=n_wires-1))
  ```
  The resulting circuit is:
  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit,expansion_strategy='device')(template_weights))
  0: ──╭C──RY(0.1)─────────────────┤
  1: ──╰X──RY(-0.3)──╭C──RY(0.1)───┤
  2: ──╭C──RY(0.1)───│─────────────┤
  3: ──╰X──RY(-0.3)──╰X──RY(-0.3)──┤ ⟨Z⟩
  ```

* Functions for tapering qubits based on molecular symmetries is added.
  [(#1966)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1966)
  [(#1974)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1974)
  [(#2041)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2041)

  With this functionality, a molecular Hamiltonian can be transformed to a new Hamiltonian that acts
  on a reduced number of qubits.

  ```python
  symbols = ["H", "H"]
  geometry = np.array([[0.0, 0.0, -0.69440367], [0.0, 0.0, 0.69440367]])
  mol = qml.hf.Molecule(symbols, geometry)
  H = qml.hf.generate_hamiltonian(mol)(geometry)
  generators, paulix_ops = qml.hf.generate_symmetries(H, len(H.wires))
  paulix_sector = qml.hf.optimal_sector(H, generators, mol.n_electrons)
  H_tapered = qml.hf.transform_hamiltonian(H, generators, paulix_ops, paulix_sector)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(H_tapered)
    ((-0.321034397355719+0j)) [I0]
  + ((0.1809270275619743+0j)) [X0]
  + ((0.7959678503870796+0j)) [Z0]
  ```

* Added the adjoint method for the metric tensor.
  [(#1992)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1992)

  This method, detailed in [Jones 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02991),
  computes the metric tensor using four copies of the state vector and
  a number of operations that scales quadratically in the number of trainable
  parameters (see below for details).

  Note that as it makes use of state cloning, it is inherently classical
  and can only be used with statevector simulators and `shots=None`.

  It is particular useful for larger circuits for which backpropagation requires
  inconvenient or even unfeasible amounts of storage, but is slower.
  Furthermore, the adjoint method is only available for analytic computation, not
  for measurements simulation with `shots!=None`.

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x, y):
      qml.Rot(*x[0], wires=0)
      qml.Rot(*x[1], wires=1)
      qml.Rot(*x[2], wires=2)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 2])
      qml.CNOT(wires=[2, 0])
      qml.RY(y[0], wires=0)
      qml.RY(y[1], wires=1)
      qml.RY(y[0], wires=2)

  x = np.array([[0.2, 0.4, -0.1], [-2.1, 0.5, -0.2], [0.1, 0.7, -0.6]], requires_grad=False)
  y = np.array([1.3, 0.2], requires_grad=True)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.adjoint_metric_tensor(circuit)(x, y)
  tensor([[ 0.25495723, -0.07086695],
          [-0.07086695,  0.24945606]], requires_grad=True)
  ```

  Computational cost

  The adjoint method uses :math:`2P^2+4P+1` gates and state cloning operations if the circuit
  is composed only of trainable gates, where :math:`P` is the number of trainable operations.
  If non-trainable gates are included, each of them is applied about :math:`n^2-n` times, where
  :math:`n` is the number of trainable operations that follow after the respective
  non-trainable operation in the circuit. This means that non-trainable gates later in the
  circuit are executed less often, making the adjoint method a bit cheaper if such gates
  appear later.
  The adjoint method requires memory for 4 independent state vectors, which corresponds roughly
  to storing a state vector of a system with 2 additional qubits.

* A new method `qml.gradients.param_shift_hessian` has been added to directly compute the Hessian
  (2nd order partial derivative matrix) of QNodes and QuantumTapes. The method generates
  parameter-shifted tapes which allow the Hessian to be computed analytically on hardware and
  software devices. Compared to using an auto-differentiation framework to compute the Hessian
  via parameter shifts, this method will use fewer device invocations and can be used to inspect
  the parameter-shifted "Hessian tapes" directly. The method remains fully differentiable on all
  supported PennyLane interfaces.

  Additionally, the parameter-shift Hessian comes with a new batch transform decorator
  `@qml.gradients.hessian_transform`, which can be used to create custom Hessian methods.
  [(#1884)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1884)

  The following code demonstrates how to use the parameter-shift Hessian:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      qml.RX(x[0], wires=0)
      qml.RY(x[1], wires=0)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

  x = np.array([0.1, 0.2], requires_grad=True)

  hessian = qml.gradients.param_shift_hessian(circuit)(x)
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> hessian
  tensor([[-0.97517033,  0.01983384],
          [ 0.01983384, -0.97517033]], requires_grad=True)
  ```

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* The function `qml.math.safe_squeeze` is introduced and `gradient_transform` allows
  for QNode argument axes of size `1`.
  [(#2080)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2080)

  `qml.math.safe_squeeze` wraps `qml.math.squeeze`, with slight modifications:

  - When provided the `axis` keyword argument, axes that do not have size `1` will be
    ignored, instead of raising an error.

  - The keyword argument `exclude_axis` allows to explicitly exclude axes from the
    squeezing.

* The `adjoint` transform now raises and error whenever the object it is applied to
  is not callable.
  [(#2060)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2060)

  An example is a list of operations to which one might apply `qml.adjoint`:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit_wrong(params):
      # Note the difference:                  v                         v
      qml.adjoint(qml.templates.AngleEmbedding(params, wires=dev.wires))
      return qml.state()

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit_correct(params):
      # Note the difference:                  v                         v
      qml.adjoint(qml.templates.AngleEmbedding)(params, wires=dev.wires)
      return qml.state()

  params = list(range(1, 3))
  ```

  The produced state is

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit_wrong(params)
  [ 0.47415988+0.j          0.        -0.73846026j  0.        -0.25903472j
   -0.40342268+0.j        ]
  ```

  but if we apply the `adjoint` correctly, we get

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit_correct(params)
  [ 0.47415988+0.j          0.         0.73846026j  0.         0.25903472j
   -0.40342268+0.j        ]
  ```

* A precision argument has been added to the tape's ``to_openqasm`` function
  to control the precision of parameters.
  [(#2071)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2071)

* Insert transform now supports adding operation after or before certain specific gates.
  [(#1980)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1980)

* Interferometer is now a class with `shape` method.
  [(#1946)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1946)

* The `CircuitGraph`, used to represent circuits via directed acyclic graphs, now
  uses RetworkX for its internal representation. This results in significant speedup
  for algorithms that rely on a directed acyclic graph representation.
  [(#1791)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1791)

* The QAOA module now accepts both NetworkX and RetworkX graphs as function inputs.
  [(#1791)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1791)

* The Barrier and Identity operations now support the `adjoint` method.
  [(#2062)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2062)
  [(#2063)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2063)

* Added a new `multi_dispatch` decorator that helps ease the definition of new functions
  inside PennyLane. We can decorate the function, indicating the arguments that are
  tensors handled by the interface:
  [(#2082)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2084)
    
  ```pycon
  >>> @qml.math.multi_dispatch(argnum=[0, 1])
  ... def some_function(tensor1, tensor2, option, like):
  ...     # the interface string is stored in ``like``.
  ...     ...
  ```
  
  Previously, this was done using the private utility function `_multi_dispatch`.
  
  ```pycon
  >>> def some_function(tensor1, tensor2, option):
  ...     interface = qml.math._multi_dispatch([tensor1, tensor2])
  ...     ...
  ```

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* `qml.metric_tensor`, `qml.adjoint_metric_tensor` and `qml.transforms.classical_jacobian`
  now follow a different convention regarding their output shape when being used
  with the Autograd interface
  [(#2059)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2059)

  See the previous entry for details. This breaking change immediately follows from
  the change in `qml.jacobian` whenever `hybrid=True` is used in the above methods.

* `qml.jacobian` now follows a different convention regarding its output shape.
  [(#2059)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2059)

  Previously, `qml.jacobian` would attempt to stack the Jacobian for multiple
  QNode arguments, which succeeded whenever the arguments have the same shape.
  In this case, the stacked Jacobian would also be transposed, leading to the 
  output shape `(*reverse_QNode_args_shape, *reverse_output_shape, num_QNode_args)`

  If no stacking and transposing occurs, the output shape instead is a `tuple`
  where each entry corresponds to one QNode argument and has the shape
  `(*output_shape, *QNode_arg_shape)`.

  This breaking change alters the behaviour in the first case and removes the attempt
  to stack and transpose, so that the output always has the shape of the second
  type.

  Note that the behaviour is unchanged --- that is, the Jacobian tuple is unpacked into
  a single Jacobian --- if `argnum=None` and there is only one QNode argument
  with respect to which the differentiation takes place, or if an integer
  is provided as `argnum`.

* The behaviour of `RotosolveOptimizer` has been changed regarding
  its keyword arguments.
  [(#2081)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2081)

  The keyword arguments `optimizer` and `optimizer_kwargs` for the
  `RotosolveOptimizer` have been renamed to `substep_optimizer`
  and `substep_kwargs`, respectively. Furthermore they have been
  moved from `step` and `step_and_cost` to the initialization `__init__`.

  The keyword argument `num_freqs` has been renamed to `nums_frequency`
  and is expected to take a different shape now:
  Previously, it was expected to be an `int` or a list of entries, with
  each entry in turn being either an `int` or a `list` of `int` entries.
  Now the expected structure is a nested dictionary, matching the
  formatting expected by
  [qml.fourier.reconstruct](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.fourier.reconstruct.html)
  This also matches the expected formatting of the new keyword arguments
  `spectra` and `shifts`.

  For more details, see the
  [RotosolveOptimizer documentation](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.RotosolveOptimizer.html).
