# Release 0.21.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fixes a bug in `classical_jacobian` when used with Torch, where the
  Jacobian of the preprocessing was also computed for non-trainable
  parameters.
  [(#2020)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2020)

* Fixes a bug in queueing of the `two_qubit_decomposition` method that
  originally led to circuits with >3 two-qubit unitaries failing when passed
  through the `unitary_to_rot` optimization transform.
  [(#2015)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2015)

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<h3>Operator class refactor</h3>

The Operator class has undergone a major refactor with the following changes:

* The `diagonalizing_gates()` representation has been moved to the highest-level 
  `Operator` class and is therefore available to all subclasses. A condition 
  `qml.operation.defines_diagonalizing_gates` has been added, which can be used 
  in tape contexts without queueing.
  [(#1985)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1985)

* A `hyperparameters` attribute was added to the operator class.
  [(#2017)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2017)

* The `string_for_inverse` attribute is removed.
  [(#2021)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2021)
