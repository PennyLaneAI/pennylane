# Release 0.40.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

* Added support for the `wire_options` dictionary to customize wire line formatting in `qml.draw_mpl` circuit
  visualizations, allowing global and per-wire customization with options like `color`, `linestyle`, and `linewidth`.
[(#6486)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6486)

* Added `qml.devices.qubit_mixed` module for mixed-state qubit device support. This module introduces:
  - A new API for mixed-state operations
  - An `apply_operation` helper function featuring:
    - Two density matrix contraction methods using `einsum` and `tensordot`
    - Optimized handling of special cases including:
      - Diagonal operators
      - Identity operators 
      - CX (controlled-X)
      - Multi-controlled X gates
      - Grover operators
  [(#6379)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6379)

* `qml.BasisRotation` template is now JIT compatible.
  [(#6019)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6019)

* Expand `ExecutionConfig.gradient_method` to store `TransformDispatcher` type.
