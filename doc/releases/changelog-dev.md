# Release 0.32.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

* `PauliWord` sparse matrices are much faster, which directly improves `PauliSentence`.
  [#4272](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4272)

* `qml.ctrl(qml.PauliX)` returns a `CNOT`, `Toffoli` or `MultiControlledX` instead of a `Controlled(PauliX)`.
  [(#4339)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4339)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* The `do_queue` keyword argument in `qml.operation.Operator` has been removed. Instead of
  setting `do_queue=False`, use the `qml.QueuingManager.stop_recording()` context.
  [(#4317)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4317)

* The `grouping_type` and `grouping_method` keyword arguments are removed from `qchem.molecular_hamiltonian`.

* `zyz_decomposition` and `xyx_decomposition` are removed. Use `one_qubit_decomposition` instead.

* `LieAlgebraOptimizer` has been removed. Use `RiemannianGradientOptimizer` instead.

* `Operation.base_name` has been removed.

* `QuantumScript.name` has been removed.

* `qml.math.reduced_dm` has been removed. Use `qml.math.reduce_dm` or `qml.math.reduce_statevector` instead.

* The ``qml.specs`` dictionary longer supports direct key access to certain keys. Instead
  these quantities can be accessed as fields of the new ``Resources`` object saved under
  ``specs_dict["resources"]``:

  - ``num_operations`` is no longer supported, use ``specs_dict["resources"].num_gates``
  - ``num_used_wires`` is no longer supported, use ``specs_dict["resources"].num_wires``
  - ``gate_types`` is no longer supported, use ``specs_dict["resources"].gate_types``
  - ``gate_sizes`` is no longer supported, use ``specs_dict["resources"].gate_sizes``
  - ``depth`` is no longer supported, use ``specs_dict["resources"].depth``

<h3>Deprecations 👋</h3>

<h3>Documentation 📝</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes 🐛</h3>

* Raise a warning if control indicators are hidden when calling `qml.draw_mpl`
