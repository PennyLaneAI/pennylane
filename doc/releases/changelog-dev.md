# Release 0.44.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

* `qml.grad` and `qml.jacobian` now lazily dispatch to catalyst and program
  capture, allowing for `qml.qjit(qml.grad(c))` and `qml.qjit(qml.jacobian(c))` to work.
  [(#8382)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8382)

* Both the generic and transform-specific application behavior of a `qml.transforms.core.TransformDispatcher`
  can be overwritten with `TransformDispatcher.generic_register` and `my_transform.register`.
  [(#7797)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7797)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* Providing ``num_steps`` to :func:`pennylane.evolve`, :func:`pennylane.exp`, :class:`pennylane.ops.Evolution`,
  and :class:`pennylane.ops.Exp` has been disallowed. Instead, use :class:`~.TrotterProduct` for approximate
  methods, providing the ``n`` parameter to perform the Suzuki-Trotter product approximation of a Hamiltonian
  with the specified number of Trotter steps.
  [(#8474)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8474)

  As a concrete example, consider the following case:

  .. code-block:: python

    coeffs = [0.5, -0.6]
    ops = [qml.X(0), qml.X(0) @ qml.Y(1)]
    H_flat = qml.dot(coeffs, ops)

  Instead of computing the Suzuki-Trotter product approximation as:

  >>> qml.evolve(H_flat, num_steps=2).decomposition()
  [RX(0.5, wires=[0]),
  PauliRot(-0.6, XY, wires=[0, 1]),
  RX(0.5, wires=[0]),
  PauliRot(-0.6, XY, wires=[0, 1])]

  The same result can be obtained using :class:`~.TrotterProduct` as follows:

  >>> decomp_ops = qml.adjoint(qml.TrotterProduct(H_flat, time=1.0, n=2)).decomposition()
  >>> [simp_op for op in decomp_ops for simp_op in map(qml.simplify, op.decomposition())]
  [RX(0.5, wires=[0]),
  PauliRot(-0.6, XY, wires=[0, 1]),
  RX(0.5, wires=[0]),
  PauliRot(-0.6, XY, wires=[0, 1])]

* `QuantumScript.shape` and `QuantumScript.numeric_type` are removed. The corresponding `MeasurementProcess`
  methods should be used instead.
  [(#8468)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8468)

* `MeasurementProcess.expand` is removed. 
  `qml.tape.QuantumScript(mp.obs.diagonalizing_gates(), [type(mp)(eigvals=mp.obs.eigvals(), wires=mp.obs.wires)])`
  can be used instead.
  [(#8468)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8468)

* The `qml.QNode.add_transform` method is removed.
  Instead, please use `QNode.transform_program.push_back(transform_container=transform_container)`.
  [(#8468)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8468)

<h3>Deprecations 👋</h3>

<h3>Internal changes ⚙️</h3>

* The experimental xDSL implementation of `diagonalize_measurements` has been updated to fix a bug
  that included the wrong SSA value for final qubit insertion and deallocation at the end of the circuit. A clear error is not also raised when there are observables with overlapping wires.
