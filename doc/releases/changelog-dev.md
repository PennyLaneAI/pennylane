# Release 0.40.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>
  
* A `DeviceCapabilities` data class is defined to contain all capabilities of the device's execution interface (i.e. its implementation of `Device.execute`). A TOML file can be used to define the capabilities of a device, and it can be loaded into a `DeviceCapabilities` object.
  [(#6407)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6407)

  ```pycon
  >>> from pennylane.devices.capabilities import load_toml_file, parse_toml_document, DeviceCapabilities
  >>> document = load_toml_file("my_device.toml")
  >>> capabilities = parse_toml_document(document)
  >>> isinstance(capabilities, DeviceCapabilities)
  True
  ```

<h4>New API for Qubit Mixed</h4>

* Added `qml.devices.qubit_mixed` module for mixed-state qubit device support [(#6379)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6379). This module introduces an `apply_operation` helper function that features:


  * Two density matrix contraction methods using `einsum` and `tensordot`

  * Optimized handling of special cases including: Diagonal operators, Identity operators, CX (controlled-X), Multi-controlled X gates, Grover operators

* Added submodule 'initialize_state' featuring a `create_initial_state` function for initializing a density matrix from `qml.StatePrep` operations or `qml.QubitDensityMatrix` operations.
  [(#6503)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6503) 

<h3>Improvements üõ†</h3>

* Added support for the `wire_options` dictionary to customize wire line formatting in `qml.draw_mpl` circuit
  visualizations, allowing global and per-wire customization with options like `color`, `linestyle`, and `linewidth`.
  [(#6486)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6486)

<h4>Capturing and representing hybrid programs</h4>

* `jax.vmap` can be captured with `qml.capture.make_plxpr` and is compatible with quantum circuits. 
  [(#6349)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6349)

<h4>Other Improvements</h4>

* `qml.BasisRotation` template is now JIT compatible.
  [(#6019)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6019)

* The Jaxpr primitives for `for_loop`, `while_loop` and `cond` now store slices instead of
  numbers of args.
  [(#6521)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6521)

* Expand `ExecutionConfig.gradient_method` to store `TransformDispatcher` type.
  [(#6455)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6455)

<h3>Breaking changes üíî</h3>

* The `qml.shadows.shadow_expval` transform has been removed. Instead, please use the
  `qml.shadow_expval` measurement process.
  [(#6530)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6530)

<h3>Deprecations üëã</h3>

<h3>Documentation üìù</h3>

* Add a warning message to Gradients and training documentation about ComplexWarnings
  [(#6543)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6543)

<h3>Bug fixes üêõ</h3>

* Fixed `Identity.__repr__` to return correct wires list.
  [(#6506)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6506)
