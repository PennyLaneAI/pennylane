# Release 0.43.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

* A compilation pass written with xDSL called `qml.compiler.python_compiler.transforms.MeasurementsFromSamplesPass`
  has been added for the experimental xDSL Python compiler integration. This pass replaces all
  terminal measurements in a program with a single :func:`pennylane.sample` measurement, and adds
  postprocessing instructions to recover the original measurement.
