# Release 0.23.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Development of a circuit-cutting compiler extension to circuits with sampling
  measurements has begun:

  - The existing `qcut.tape_to_graph()` method has been extended to convert a
    sample measurement without an observable specified to multiple single-qubit sample
    nodes.
    [(#2313)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2313)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* The function `qml.ctrl` was given the optional argument `control_values=None`.
  If overridden, `control_values` takes an integer or a list of integers corresponding to
  the binary value that each control value should take. The same change is reflected in
  `ControlledOperation`. Control values of `0` are implemented by `qml.PauliX` applied
  before and after the controlled operation
