# Release 0.46.0 (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

<h3>Labs: a place for unified and rapid prototyping of research software 🧪</h3>

* Created a new ``~.labs.templates.LeftQuantumComparator`` template for performing inequality test of two quantum registers.
  [(#9277)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/9277)

  ```python
  import pennylane as qp
  from pennylane.labs.templates import LeftQuantumComparator
  
  dev = qp.device("lightning.qubit")

  @qp.qnode(dev, shots=1)
  def circuit(a, comparator, b):
    x_wires = [0, 3, 6, 9]
    y_wires = [1, 4, 7, 10]
    work_wires = [2, 5, 8]
    qp.BasisState(a, wires=x_wires)
    qp.BasisState(b, wires=y_wires)
    LeftQuantumComparator(x_wires, y_wires, 11, work_wires, comparator)
    qp.CNOT(wires=[11, 12])
    qp.adjoint(LeftQuantumComparator(x_wires, y_wires, 11, work_wires, comparator))

    return qp.sample(wires=[12])
  ```
  
  ```pycon
    >>> output = circuit(3, ">=", 2)
    >>> print(bool(output))
    True
  
  ```

<h3>Bug fixes 🐛</h3>

* Fixed a bug where `qp.qnn.TorchLayer` produced incorrect output shape `(n_measurements, batch, 1)`
  instead of `(batch, n_measurements)` when the wrapped QNode returns multiple measurements as a tuple
  (e.g., `return qp.expval(qp.Z(0)), qp.expval(qp.Z(1))`) and receives batched inputs. This
  previously caused shape mismatch errors when feeding the output into downstream `torch.nn.Linear`
  layers.
