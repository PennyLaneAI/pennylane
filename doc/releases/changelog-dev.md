<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

<h4>Other Improvements</h4>

* Added `qml.devices.qubit_mixed` module for mixed-state qubit device support. This module introduces:
  - A new API for mixed-state operations
  - An `apply_operation` helper function featuring:
    - Two density matrix contraction methods using `einsum` and `tensordot`
    - Optimized handling of special cases including:
      - Diagonal operators
      - Identity operators 
      - CX (controlled-X)
      - Multi-controlled X gates
      - Grover operators
