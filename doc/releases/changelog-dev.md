# Release 0.30.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* The `sample_state` function is added to `devices/qubit` that returns a series of samples based on a given
  state vector and a number of shots.
  [(#3720)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3720)

* Added the needed functions and classes to simulate an ensemble of Rydberg atoms:
  * A new internal `RydbergHamiltonian` class is added, which contains the Hamiltonian of an ensemble of
    Rydberg atoms.
  * A new user-facing `rydberg_interaction` function is added, which returns a `RydbergHamiltonian` containing
    the Hamiltonian of the interaction of all the Rydberg atoms.
  * A new user-facing `drive` function is added, which returns a `HardwareHamiltonian` containing
    the Hamiltonian of the interaction between a driving electro-magnetic field and a group of qubits.
  [(#3749)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3749)
  [(#3911)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3911)
  [(#3930)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3930)

* Added `Operation.__truediv__` dunder method to be able to divide operators.
  [(#3749)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3749)

* The `simulate` function added to `devices/qubit` now supports measuring expectation values of large observables such as
  `qml.Hamiltonian`, `qml.SparseHamiltonian`, `qml.Sum`.
  [(#3759)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3759)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Keras and Torch NN modules are now compatible with the new return type system.
  [(#3913)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3913)
  [(#3914)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3914)

* The adjoint differentiation method now supports more operations, and does no longer decompose
  some operations that may be differentiated directly. In addition, all new operations with a
  generator are now supported by the method.
  [(#3874)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3874)

* The `coefficients` function and the `visualize` submodule of the `qml.fourier` module
  now allow assigning different degrees for different parameters of the input function.
  [(#3005)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3005)

  The arguments `degree` and `filter_threshold` to `qml.fourier.coefficients` previously were
  expected to be integers, and now can be a sequences of integers with one integer per function
  parameter (i.e. `len(degree)==n_inputs`), resulting in a returned array with shape
  `(2*degrees[0]+1,..., 2*degrees[-1]+1)`.
  The functions in `qml.fourier.visualize` accordingly accept such arrays of coefficients.

* `Operator` now has a `has_generator` attribute that returns whether or not the operator
  has a generator defined. It is used in `qml.operation.has_gen`, improving its performance.
  [(#3875)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3875)

* The custom JVP rules in PennyLane now also support non-scalar and mixed-shape tape parameters as
  well as multi-dimensional tape return types, like broadcasted `qml.probs`, for example.
  [(#3766)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3766)

* The `qchem.jordan_wigner` function is extended to support more fermionic operator orders.
  [(#3754)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3754)
  [(#3751)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3751)

* `AdaptiveOptimizer` is updated to use non-default user-defined qnode arguments.
  [(#3765)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3765)

* Adds logic to `qml.devices.qubit.measure` to compute the expectation values of `Hamiltonian` and `Sum `
  in a backpropagation compatible way.
  [(#3862)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3862/)

* Use `TensorLike` type in `Operator` dunder methods.
  [(#3749)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3749)

* The `apply_operation` function added to `devices/qubit` now supports broadcasting.
  [(#3852)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3852)

* `qml.QubitStateVector.state_vector` now supports broadcasting.
  [(#3852)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3852)
  
* `pennylane.devices.qubit.preprocess` now allows circuits with non-commuting observables.
  [(#3857)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3857)

* When using Jax-jit with gradient transforms the trainable parameters are correctly set (instead of every parameter 
  to be set as trainable), and therefore the derivatives are computed more efficiently.
  [(#3697)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3697)

* `qml.SparseHamiltonian` can now be applied to any wires in a circuit rather than being restricted to all wires
  in the circuit.
  [(#3888)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3888)

* Added `max_distance` keyword argument to `qml.pulse.rydberg_interaction` to allow removal of negligible contributions
  from atoms beyond `max_distance`from each other.
  [(#3889)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3889)

* 3 new decomposition algorithms are added for n-controlled operations with single-qubit target,
  and are selected automatically when they produce a better result. They can be accessed via
  `ops.op_math.ctrl_decomp_bisect`.
  [(#3851)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3851)

* `repr` for `MutualInfoMP` now displays the distribution of the wires between the two subsystems.
  [(#3898)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3898)

* Changed `Operator.num_wires` from an abstract value to `AnyWires`.
  [(#3919)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3919)

* Do not run `qml.transforms.sum_expand` in `Device.batch_transform` if the device supports Sum observables.
  [(#3915)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3915)

* `CompositeOp` now overrides `Operator._check_batching`, providing a significant performance improvement.
  `Hamiltonian` also overrides this method and does nothing, because it does not support batching.
  [(#3915)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3915)

* If a `Sum` operator has a pre-computed Pauli representation, `is_hermitian` now checks that all coefficients
  are real, providing a significant performance improvement.
  [(#3915)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3915)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* Both JIT interfaces are not compatible with Jax `>0.4.3`, we raise an error for those versions.
  [(#3877)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3877)

* An operation that implements a custom `generator` method, but does not always return a valid generator, also has
  to implement a `has_generator` property that reflects in which scenarios a generator will be returned.
  [(#3875)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3875)
 
* Trainable parameters for the Jax interface are the parameters that are `JVPTracer`, defined by setting
  `argnums`. Previously, all JAX tracers, including those used for JIT compilation, were interpreted to be trainable.
  [(#3697)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3697)

* The keyword argument `argnums` is now used for gradient transform using Jax, instead of `argnum`.
  `argnum` is automatically converted to `argnums` when using JAX, and will no longer be supported in v0.31.
  [(#3697)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3697)
  [(#3847)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3847)

* Made `qml.OrbitalRotation` and consequently `qml.GateFabric` consistent with the interleaved Jordan-Wigner ordering.
  Previously, they were consistent with the sequential Jordan-Wigner ordering.
  [(#3861)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3861)

* Some `MeasurementProcess` classes can now only be instantiated with arguments that they will actually use.
  For example, you can no longer create `StateMP(qml.PauliX(0))` or `PurityMP(eigvals=(-1,1), wires=Wires(0))`.
  [(#3898)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3898)

<h3>Deprecations</h3>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

* A typo was corrected in the documentation for introduction to `inspecting_circuits` and `chemistry`.
[(#3844)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3844)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* `MeasurementProcess.hash` now uses the hash property of the observable. The property now depends on all
  properties that affect the behaviour of the object, such as `VnEntropyMP.log_base` or the distribution of wires between
  the two subsystems in `MutualInfoMP`.
  [(#3898)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3898)

* The enum `measurements.Purity` is added so that `PurityMP.return_type` is defined. `str` and `repr` for `PurityMP` are now defined.
  [(#3898)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3898)

* `Sum.hash` and `Prod.hash` are slightly changed
  to work with non-numeric wire labels.  `sum_expand` should now return correct results and not treat some products as the same
  operation.
  [(#3898)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3898)

* Fixed bug where the coefficients where not ordered correctly when summing a `ParametrizedHamiltonian`
  with other operators.
  [(#3749)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3749)
  [(#3902)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3902)

* The metric tensor transform is fully compatible with Jax and therefore users can provide multiple parameters.
  [(#3847)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3847)

* Registers `math.ndim` and `math.shape` for built-ins and autograd to accomodate Autoray 0.6.1.
  [#3864](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3865)

* Ensure that `qml.data.load` returns datasets in a stable and expected order.
  [(#3856)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3856)

* The `qml.equal` function now handles comparisons of `ParametrizedEvolution` operators.
  [(#3870)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3870)

* Made `qml.OrbitalRotation` and consequently `qml.GateFabric` consistent with the interleaved Jordan-Wigner ordering.
  [(#3861)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3861)

* `qml.devices.qubit.apply_operation` catches the `tf.errors.UnimplementedError` that occurs when `PauliZ` or `CNOT` gates
  are applied to a large (>8 wires) tensorflow state. When that occurs, the logic falls back to the tensordot logic instead.
  [(#3884)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3884/)

* Fixed parameter broadcasting support with `qml.counts` in most cases, and introduced explicit errors otherwise.
  [(#3876)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3876)

* An error is now raised if a `QNode` with Jax-jit in use returns `counts` while having trainable parameters
  [(#3892)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3892)

* A correction is added to the reference values in `test_dipole_of` to account for small changes
  (~2e-8) in the computed dipole moment values, resulting from the new [PySCF 2.2.0](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/releases/tag/v2.2.0) release.
