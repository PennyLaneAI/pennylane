# Release 0.38.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* A new method `process_density_matrix` has been added to the `ProbabilityMP` and `DensityMatrixMP` classes, allowing for more efficient handling of quantum density matrices, particularly with batch processing support. This method simplifies the calculation of probabilities from quantum states represented as density matrices.
  [(#5830)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5830)

* The `qml.PrepSelPrep` template is added. The template implements a block-encoding of a linear 
  combination of unitaries.
  [(#5756)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5756)

* `SProd.terms` now flattens out the terms if the base is a multi-term observable.
  [(#5885)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5885)
  
<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

* Port the fast `apply_operation` implementation of `PauliZ` to `PhaseShift`, `S` and `T`.
  [(#5876)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5876)

* `qml.UCCSD` now accepts an additional optional argument, `n_repeats`, which defines the number of
  times the UCCSD template is repeated. This can improve the accuracy of the template by reducing
  the Trotter error but would result in deeper circuits.
  [(#5801)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5801)

* `QuantumScript.hash` is now cached, leading to performance improvements.
  [(#5919)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5919)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

<h3>Deprecations 👋</h3>

<h3>Documentation 📝</h3>

* Improves the docstring for `QuantumScript.expand` and `qml.tape.tape.expand_tape`.
  [(#5974)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5974)

<h3>Bug fixes 🐛</h3>

* `qml.AmplitudeEmbedding` has better support for features using low precision integer data types.
