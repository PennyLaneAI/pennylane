# Release 0.21.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Interferometer is now a class with `shape` method.
  [(#1946)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1946)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fixes a bug where PennyLane didn't require v0.20.0 of PennyLane-Lightning,
  but raised an error with versions of Lightning earlier than v0.20.0 due to
  the new batch execution pipeline.
  [(#2033)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2033)

* Fixes a bug in `classical_jacobian` when used with Torch, where the
  Jacobian of the preprocessing was also computed for non-trainable
  parameters.
  [(#2020)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2020)

* Fixes a bug in queueing of the `two_qubit_decomposition` method that
  originally led to circuits with >3 two-qubit unitaries failing when passed
  through the `unitary_to_rot` optimization transform.
  [(#2015)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2015)

<h3>Documentation</h3>

* Extended the interfaces description page to explicitly mention device
  compatibility.
  [(#2031)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2031)

<h3>Operator class refactor</h3>

The Operator class has undergone a major refactor with the following changes:

* The `diagonalizing_gates()` representation has been moved to the highest-level
  `Operator` class and is therefore available to all subclasses. A condition
  `qml.operation.defines_diagonalizing_gates` has been added, which can be used
  in tape contexts without queueing.
  [(#1985)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1985)

* A static `compute_diagonalizing_gates` method has been added, which is called 
  by default in `diagonalizing_gates()`.
  [(#1993)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1993)

* A `hyperparameters` attribute was added to the operator class.
  [(#2017)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2017)
  
* The representation of an operator as a matrix has been overhauled. 
  
  The `matrix()` method now accepts a 
  `wire_order` argument and calculates the correct numerical representation 
  with respect to that ordering. 
    
  ```pycon
  >>> op = qml.RX(0.5, wires="b")
  >>> op.matrix()
  [[0.96891242+0.j         0.        -0.24740396j]
   [0.        -0.24740396j 0.96891242+0.j        ]]
  >>> op.matrix(wire_order=["a", "b"])
  [[0.9689+0.j  0.-0.2474j 0.+0.j         0.+0.j]
   [0.-0.2474j  0.9689+0.j 0.+0.j         0.+0.j]
   [0.+0.j          0.+0.j 0.9689+0.j 0.-0.2474j]
   [0.+0.j          0.+0.j 0.-0.2474j 0.9689+0.j]]
  ```
    
  The "canonical matrix", which is independent of wires,
  is now defined in the static method `compute_matrix()` instead of `_matrix`.
  By default, this method is assumed to take all parameters and non-trainable 
  hyperparameters that define the operation. 
    
  ```pycon
  >>> qml.RX.compute_matrix(0.5)
  [[0.96891242+0.j         0.        -0.24740396j]
   [0.        -0.24740396j 0.96891242+0.j        ]]
  ```
       
  If no canonical matrix is specified for a gate, `compute_matrix()` 
  returns `None`, whereas previously `NotImplementedErrors` 
  were raised.
  
  The new `matrix()` method is now used in the 
  `pennylane.transforms.get_qubit_unitary()` transform.
  [(#1996)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1996)

* The `string_for_inverse` attribute is removed.
  [(#2021)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2021)

* The generator property has been updated to an instance method,
  `Operation.generator()`. It now returns an instantiated operation,
  representing the generator of the instantiated operator.
  [(#2030)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2030)

  Various operators have been updated to specify the generator as either
  an `Observable`, `Tensor`, `Hamiltonian`, `SparseHamiltonian`, or `Hermitian`
  operator.

  In addition, a temporary utility function get_generator has been added
  to the utils module, to automate:

  - Extracting the matrix representation
  - Extracting the 'coefficient' if possible (only occurs if the generator is a single Pauli word)
  - Converting a Hamiltonian to a sparse matrix if there are more than 1 Pauli word present.
  - Negating the coefficient/taking the adjoint of the matrix if the operation was inverted

  This utility logic is currently needed because:

  - Extracting the matrix representation is not supported natively on
    Hamiltonians and SparseHamiltonians.
  - By default, calling `op.generator()` does not take into account `op.inverse()`.
  - If the generator is a single Pauli word, it is convenient to have access to
    both the coefficient and the observable separately.
