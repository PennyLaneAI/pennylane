# Release 0.20.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* A thermal relaxation channel is added to the Noisy channels. The channel description can be 
  found on the supplementary information of [Quantum classifier with tailored quantum kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02611).
  [(#1766)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1766)
  
* Added the identity observable to be an operator. Now we can explicitly call the identity 
  operation on our quantum circuits for both qubit and CV devices.
  [(#1829)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1829) 

* Added density matrix initialization gate for mixed state simulation. [(#1686)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/issues/1686)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Tests do not loop over automatically imported and instantiated operations any more, 
  which was opaque and created unnecessarily many tests.
  [(#1895)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1895)

* A `decompose()` method has been added to the `Operator` class such that we can
  obtain (and queue) decompositions directly from instances of operations.
  [(#1873)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1873)

  ```pycon
  >>> op = qml.PhaseShift(0.3, wires=0)
  >>> op.decompose()
  [RZ(0.3, wires=[0])]
  ```
  
* ``qml.circuit_drawer.draw_mpl`` produces a matplotlib figure and axes given a tape.
  [(#1787)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1787)

* AngleEmbedding now supports `batch_params` decorator. [(#1812)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1812)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* The static method `decomposition()`, formerly in the `Operation` class, has
  been moved to the base `Operator` class.
  [(#1873)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1873)
  
* `DiagonalOperation` is not a separate subclass any more. 
  [(#1889)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1889) 

  Instead, devices can check for the diagonal 
  property using attributes:

  ``` python
  from pennylane.ops.qubit.attributes import diagonal_in_z_basis

  if op in diagonal_in_z_basis:
      # do something
  ``` 

<h3>Deprecations</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* `qml.circuit_drawer.MPLDrawer` was slightly modified to work with
  matplotlib version 3.5.
  [(#1899)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1899)

* `qml.CSWAP` and `qml.CRot` now define `control_wires`, and `qml.SWAP` 
  returns the default empty wires object.
  [(#1830)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1830)

* The `requires_grad` attribute of `qml.numpy.tensor` objects is now
  preserved when pickling/unpickling the object.
  [(#1856)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1856)
