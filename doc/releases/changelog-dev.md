# Release 0.42.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h4>State-of-the-art templates and decompositions üêù</h4>

* A new decomposition based on *unary iteration* has been added to :class:`qml.Select`.
  This decomposition reduces the :class:`T` count significantly, and uses :math:`c-1`
  auxiliary wires for a :class:`qml.Select` operation with :math:`c` control wires.
  Unary iteration leverages these auxiliary wires to store intermediate values for reuse
  among the different multi-controlled operators, avoiding unnecessary recomputation.
  Check out the documentation for a thorough explanation.
  [(#7623)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7623)
  [(#7744)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7744)

* A new template :class:`~.TemporaryAND` has been added. The  :class:`~.TemporaryAND` (a.k.a.  :class:`~.Elbow`)
  operation is a three-qubit gate equivalent to an ``AND``, or reversible :class:`~pennylane.Toffoli`, gate
  that leverages extra information about the target wire to enable more efficient circuit decompositions.
  The ``TemporaryAND`` assumes the target qubit to be initialized in ``|0„Äâ``, while the ``Adjoint(TemporaryAND)`` assumes the target output to be ``|0„Äâ``.
  For more details, see Fig. 4 in `arXiv:1805.03662 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03662>`_.
  :class:`~.TemporaryAND` is useful for an efficient decomposition of the :class:`~.Select` template, for example. 
  [(#7472)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7472)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", shots=1)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      # |0000‚ü©
      qml.X(0) # |1000‚ü©
      qml.X(1) # |1100‚ü©
      # The target wire is in state |0>, so we can apply TemporaryAND
      qml.TemporaryAND([0,1,2]) # |1110‚ü©
      qml.CNOT([2,3]) # |1111‚ü©
      # The target wire will be in state |0> after adjoint(TemporaryAND) gate is applied, so we can apply adjoint(TemporaryAND)
      qml.adjoint(qml.TemporaryAND([0,1,2])) # |1101‚ü©
      return qml.sample(wires=[0,1,2,3])
  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> print(circuit())
  [1 1 0 1]
  ```

* A new template :class:`~.SemiAdder` has been added, allowing for quantum-quantum in-place addition.
  This operator performs the plain addition of two integers in the computational basis.
  [(#7494)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7494)

  ```python
  x = 3
  y = 4

  wires = qml.registers({"x":3, "y":6, "work":5})

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", shots=1)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.BasisEmbedding(x, wires=wires["x"])
      qml.BasisEmbedding(y, wires=wires["y"])
      qml.SemiAdder(wires["x"], wires["y"], wires["work"])
      return qml.sample(wires=wires["y"])
  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> print(circuit())
  [0 0 0 1 1 1]
  ```

* A new template called :class:`~.SelectPauliRot` that applies a sequence of uniformly controlled rotations to a target qubit 
  is now available. This operator appears frequently in unitary decomposition and block encoding techniques.

  [(#7617)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7617)

  ```python
  angles = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.SelectPauliRot(
        angles,
        control_wires=wires["control"],

<h4>QSVT & QSP angle solver for large polynomials üï∏Ô∏è</h4>

* A new iterative angle solver for QSVT and QSP is available in the :func:`poly_to_angles <pennylane.poly_to_angles>` function,
  allowing angle computation for polynomials of large degrees (> 1000).
  Set `angle_solver="iterative"` in the :func:`poly_to_angles  <pennylane.poly_to_angles>` function
  (or from the :func:`qsvt <pennylane.qsvt>` function!) to use it.
  [(6694)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6694)

<h4>Qualtran integration üîó</h4>

* It's now possible to convert PennyLane operators to [Qualtran](https://qualtran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) bloqs with the new :func:`qml.to_bloq <pennylane.to_bloq>` function. 
  [(#7197)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7197)
  [(#7604)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7604)
  [(#7536)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7536)
  
  :func:`qml.to_bloq <pennylane.to_bloq>` translates PennyLane operators into equivalent [Qualtran bloqs](https://qualtran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bloqs/index.html#bloqs-library). It requires one input and takes in two optional inputs:
  * ``circuit (QNode| Qfunc | Operation)``: a PennyLane ``QNode``, ``Qfunc``, or operator to be wrapped as a Qualtran Bloq.
  * ``map_ops (bool)``: Whether to map operations to a Qualtran Bloq. Operations are wrapped as a ``ToBloq`` when ``False``. Default is ``True``.
  * custom_mapping (dict): Dictionary to specify a mapping between a PennyLane operator and a Qualtran Bloq. A default mapping is used if not defined.
  The following example converts a PennyLane Operator into a Qualtran Bloq:

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  from qualtran.drawing import get_musical_score_data, draw_musical_score, show_bloq

  control_wires = [2, 3]
  estimation_wires = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  H = -0.4 * qml.Z(0) + 0.3 * qml.Z(1) + 0.4 * qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(1)

  op = qml.QuantumPhaseEstimation(
      qml.Qubitization(H, control_wires), estimation_wires=estimation_wires
  )

  cbloq = qml.to_bloq(op).decompose_bloq()
  fig, ax = draw_musical_score(get_musical_score_data(cbloq))
  show_bloq(cbloq)
  ```

  Let's define a custom mapping instead.

  ```python
  from qualtran.bloqs.phase_estimation import LPResourceState
  from qualtran.bloqs.phase_estimation.text_book_qpe import TextbookQPE

  custom_map = {
    op: TextbookQPE(
        unitary=qml.to_bloq(qml.Qubitization(H, control_wires)), 
        ctrl_state_prep=LPResourceState(len(estimation_wires))
    )
  }

  cbloq = qml.to_bloq(op, map_ops=True, custom_mapping=custom_map).decompose_bloq()
  draw_musical_score(get_musical_score_data(cbloq))
  show_bloq(cbloq)
  ```

  Alternatively, rather than map directly to a Qualtran Bloq, we can preserve the original
  PennyLane decomposition by setting `map_ops` to False.

  ```python
  op_wrapped_as_bloq = qml.to_bloq(op, map_ops=False)
  cbloq = op_wrapped_as_bloq.decompose_bloq()
  draw_musical_score(get_musical_score_data(cbloq))
  show_bloq(cbloq)

  # We can also leverage Qualtran features to get resource counts and call graphs, among other things
  from qualtran.drawing import show_call_graph, show_counts_sigma  

  graph, sigma = qml.to_bloq(op, map_ops=True).call_graph()
  show_call_graph(graph)
  show_counts_sigma(sigma)
  ```

<h4>Resource-efficient Clifford-T decompositions üçÉ</h4>

* A new decomposition method for :func:`~.clifford_t_decomposition` is now available with `method="rs"`
  (the [Ross-Selinger algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2975)) that produces orders of magnitude
  less gates than `method="sk"` (the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm) in many cases. It is directly accessible
  via :func:`~.ops.rs_decomposition` function.
  [(#7588)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7588)
  [(#7641)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7641)
  [(#7611)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7611)
  [(#7711)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7711)

  The Ross-Selinger algorithm can drastically outperform the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm in many cases.
  Consider this simple circuit:

  ```python
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2))
  def circuit(x, y):

      qml.RX(x, 0)
      qml.CNOT([0, 1])
      qml.RY(y, 0)

      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))

  rs_circuit = qml.clifford_t_decomposition(circuit, method="rs")
  sk_circuit = qml.clifford_t_decomposition(circuit, method="sk")

  rs_specs = qml.specs(rs_circuit)(x, y)["resources"]
  sk_specs = qml.specs(sk_circuit)(x, y)["resources"]
  ```

  Decomposing with `method="rs"` instead of `method="sk"` gives a significant reduction in overall 
  gate counts, specifically the `qml.T` count:

  ```pycon
  >>> print(rs_specs.num_gates, sk_specs.num_gates)
  267 48637
  >>> print(rs_specs.gate_types['T'], sk_specs.gate_types['T'])
  104 8507
  ```

* Improved performance for `qml.clifford_t_decomposition` transform by introducing caching support and changed the
  default basis set of `qml.ops.sk_decomposition` to `(H, S, T)`, resulting in shorter decomposition sequences.
  [(#7454)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7454)

<h4>OpenQASM ü§ù PennyLane</h4>

* A new function called :func:`qml.from_qasm3` has been added, which converts OpenQASM 3.0 circuits into quantum functions
  that can be subsequently loaded into QNodes and executed. 
  [(#7432)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7432)
  [(#7486)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7486)
  [(#7488)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7488)
  [(#7593)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7593)
  [(#7498)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7498)

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=[0, 1])
  
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def my_circuit():
      qml.from_qasm3("qubit q0; qubit q1; ry(0.2) q0; rx(1.0) q1; pow(2) @ x q0;", {'q0': 0, 'q1': 1})
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(my_circuit)())
  0: ‚îÄ‚îÄRY(0.20)‚îÄ‚îÄX¬≤‚îÄ‚î§  <Z>
  1: ‚îÄ‚îÄRX(1.00)‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§  
  ```
  
  Some gates and operations in OpenQASM 3.0 programs are not currently supported. For more details, 
  please consult the documentation for :func:`qml.from_qasm3` and ensure that you have installed `openqasm3` and 
  `'openqasm3[parser]'` in your environment by following the [OpenQASM 3.0 installation instructions](https://pypi.org/project/openqasm3/).

* A new function called `qml.to_openqasm` has been added, which allows for converting PennyLane circuits to OpenQASM 2.0 programs.
  [(#7393)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7393)

  Consider this simple circuit in PennyLane:
  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2, shots=100)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(theta, phi):
      qml.RX(theta, wires=0)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0,1])
      qml.RZ(phi, wires=1)
      return qml.sample()
  ```

  This can be easily converted to OpenQASM 2.0 with `qml.to_openqasm`:
  ```pycon
  >>> openqasm_circ = qml.to_openqasm(circuit)(1.2, 0.9)
  >>> print(openqasm_circ)
  OPENQASM 2.0;
  include "qelib1.inc";
  qreg q[2];
  creg c[2];
  rx(1.2) q[0];
  cx q[0],q[1];
  rz(0.9) q[1];
  measure q[0] -> c[0];
  measure q[1] -> c[1];
  ```

<h3>Improvements üõ†</h3>

<h4>Resource-efficient decompositions üîé</h4>

* The :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform now supports weighting gates in the target `gate_set`, allowing for 
  preferential treatment of certain gates in a target `gate_set` over others.
  [(#7389)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7389)

  Gates specified in `gate_set` can be given a numerical weight associated with their effective cost to have in a circuit:
  
  * Gate weights that are greater than 1 indicate a *greater cost* (less preferred).
  * Gate weights that are less than 1 indicate a *lower cost* (more preferred).

  Consider the following toy example.

  ```python
  qml.decomposition.enable_graph()
  
  @partial(
    qml.transforms.decompose, gate_set={qml.Toffoli: 1.23, qml.RX: 4.56, qml.CZ: 0.01, qml.H: 420, qml.CRZ: 100}
  )
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
  def circuit():
      qml.CRX(0.1, wires=[0, 1])
      qml.Toffoli(wires=[0, 1, 2])
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())

  0: ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ï≠‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ï≠‚óè‚îÄ‚ï≠‚óè‚îÄ‚î§  <Z>
  1: ‚îÄ‚îÄRX(0.05)‚îÄ‚ï∞Z‚îÄ‚îÄRX(-0.05)‚îÄ‚ï∞Z‚îÄ‚îú‚óè‚îÄ‚î§     
  2: ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ï∞X‚îÄ‚î§     
  ```

  ```python
  qml.decomposition.enable_graph()

  @partial(
      qml.transforms.decompose, gate_set={qml.Toffoli: 1.23, qml.RX: 4.56, qml.CZ: 0.01, qml.H: 0.1, qml.CRZ: 0.1}
  )
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
  def circuit():
      qml.CRX(0.1, wires=[0, 1])
      qml.Toffoli(wires=[0, 1, 2])
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())

  0: ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ï≠‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ï≠‚óè‚îÄ‚î§  <Z>
  1: ‚îÄ‚îÄH‚îÄ‚ï∞RZ(0.10)‚îÄ‚îÄH‚îÄ‚îú‚óè‚îÄ‚î§     
  2: ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ï∞X‚îÄ‚î§  
  ```

  Here, when the Hadamard and ``CRZ`` have relatively high weights, a decomposition involving them is considered *less* 
  efficient. When they have relatively low weights, a decomposition involving them is considered *more* efficient.

* Decomposition rules that can be accessed with the new graph-based decomposition system are
  implemented for the following operators:

  * :class:`~.QubitUnitary`
    [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

  * :class:`~.ControlledQubitUnitary`
    [(#7371)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7371)

  * :class:`~.DiagonalQubitUnitary`
    [(#7625)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7625)

  * :class:`~.MultiControlledX`
    [(#7405)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7405)

  * :class:`~pennylane.ops.Exp`. 
    [(#7489)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7489)

    Specifically, the following decompositions have been added:
    * Suzuki-Trotter decomposition when the `num_steps` keyword argument is specified.
    * Decomposition to a :class:`~pennylane.PauliRot` when the base is a single-term Pauli word.

  * :class:`~.PCPhase`
    [(#7591)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7591)

  * :class:`~.QuantumPhaseEstimation`
    [(#7637)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7637)

  * :class:`~.BasisRotation`
    [(#7074)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7074)

  * :class:`~.PhaseAdder`
    [(#7070)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7070)

  * :class:`~.IntegerComparator`
    [(#7636)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7636)

* A new decomposition rule that uses a single work wire for decomposing multi-controlled operators is added.
  [(#7383)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7383)

* A :func:`~.decomposition.register_condition` decorator is added that allows users to bind a condition to a
  decomposition rule for when it is applicable. The condition should be a function that takes the
  resource parameters of an operator as arguments and returns `True` or `False` based on whether
  these parameters satisfy the condition for when this rule can be applied.
  [(#7439)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7439)

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  from pennylane.math.decomposition import zyz_rotation_angles
  
  # The parameters must be consistent with ``qml.QubitUnitary.resource_keys``
  def _zyz_condition(num_wires):
    return num_wires == 1

  @qml.register_condition(_zyz_condition)
  @qml.register_resources({qml.RZ: 2, qml.RY: 1, qml.GlobalPhase: 1})
  def zyz_decomposition(U, wires, **__):
      # Assumes that U is a 2x2 unitary matrix
      phi, theta, omega, phase = zyz_rotation_angles(U, return_global_phase=True)
      qml.RZ(phi, wires=wires[0])
      qml.RY(theta, wires=wires[0])
      qml.RZ(omega, wires=wires[0])
      qml.GlobalPhase(-phase)
  
  # This decomposition will be ignored for `QubitUnitary` on more than one wire.
  qml.add_decomps(qml.QubitUnitary, zyz_decomposition)
  ```

* Symbolic operator types (e.g., `Adjoint`, `Controlled`, and `Pow`) can now be specified as strings
  in various parts of the new graph-based decomposition system, specifically:

  * The `gate_set` argument of the :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform now supports adding symbolic
    operators in the target gate set.
    [(#7331)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7331)

  ```python
  from functools import partial
  import pennylane as qml

  @partial(qml.transforms.decompose, gate_set={"T", "Adjoint(T)", "H", "CNOT"})
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))

  ```

  * Symbolic operator types can now be given as strings to the `op_type` argument of :func:`~.decomposition.add_decomps`,
    or as keys of the dictionaries passed to the `alt_decomps` and `fixed_decomps` arguments of the
    :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform, allowing custom decomposition rules to be defined and
    registered for symbolic operators.

  ```

* A `work_wire_type` argument has been added to :func:`~pennylane.ctrl` and :class:`~pennylane.ControlledQubitUnitary`
  for more fine-grained control over the type of work wire used in their decompositions.
  [(#7612)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7612)

* The :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform now accepts a `stopping_condition` argument with 
  graph-based decomposition enabled, which must be a function that returns `True` if an operator 
  does not need to be decomposed (it meets the requirements as described in `stopping_condition`).
  See the documentation for more details.
  [(#7531)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7531)

* Two-qubit `QubitUnitary` gates no longer decompose into fundamental rotation gates; it now 
  decomposes into single-qubit `QubitUnitary` gates. This allows the decomposition system to
  further decompose single-qubit unitary gates more flexibly using different rotations.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

* The `gate_set` argument of :func:`~.transforms.decompose` now accepts `"X"`, `"Y"`, `"Z"`, `"H"`, 
  `"I"` as aliases for `"PauliX"`, `"PauliY"`, `"PauliZ"`, `"Hadamard"`, and `"Identity"`. These 
  aliases are also recognized as part of symbolic operators. For example, `"Adjoint(H)"` is now 
  accepted as an alias for `"Adjoint(Hadamard)"`.
  [(#7331)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7331)

<h4>Setting shots üîÅ</h4>

* A new QNode transform called :func:`~.transforms.set_shots` has been added to set or update the number of shots to be performed, overriding shots specified in the device.
  [(#7337)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7337)
  [(#7358)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7358)
  [(#7500)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7500)
  [(#7627)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7627)

  The :func:`~.transforms.set_shots` transform can be used as a decorator:

  ```python
  @partial(qml.set_shots, shots=2)
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit", wires=1))
  def circuit():
      qml.RX(1.23, wires=0)
      return qml.sample(qml.Z(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit()
  array([1., -1.])
  ```
  
  Additionally, it can be used in-line to update a circuit's `shots`:

  ```pycon
  >>> new_circ = qml.set_shots(circuit, shots=(4, 10)) # shot vector
  >>> new_circ()
  (array([-1.,  1., -1.,  1.]), array([ 1.,  1.,  1., -1.,  1.,  1., -1., -1.,  1.,  1.]))
  ```

<h4>QChem</h4>

* The `qchem` module is upgraded with new functions to construct a vibrational Hamiltonian in 
  the Christiansen representation. 
  [(#7491)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7491)
  [(#7596)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7596)

  The new functions :func:`christiansen_hamiltonian` and :func:`qml.qchem.christiansen_bosonic` can
  be used to create the qubit and bosonic form of the Christiansen Hamiltonian, respectively. These
  functions need input parameters that can be easily obtained by using the
  :func:`christiansen_integrals` and :func:`vibrational_pes` functions. Similarly, a Christiansen
  dipole operator can be created by using the :func:`christiansen_dipole` and
  :func:`christiansen_integrals_dipole` functions.

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  import numpy as np

  symbols  = ['H', 'F']
  geometry = np.array([[0.0, 0.0, -0.40277116], [0.0, 0.0, 1.40277116]])
  mol = qml.qchem.Molecule(symbols, geometry)
  pes = qml.qchem.vibrational_pes(mol, optimize=False)
  ham = qml.qchem.vibrational.christiansen_hamiltonian(pes, n_states = 4)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> ham
  (

  ```  

<h4>Experimental FTQC module</h4>

* Add commutation rules for a Clifford gate set (`qml.H`, `qml.S`, `qml.CNOT`) to the `ftqc.pauli_tracker` module,
  accessible via the `commute_clifford_op` function.
  [(#7444)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7444)

* Add offline byproduct correction support to the `ftqc` module.
  [(#7447)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7447)

* The `ftqc` module `measure_arbitrary_basis`, `measure_x` and `measure_y` functions
  can now be captured when program capture is enabled.
  [(#7219)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7219)
  [(#7368)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7368)

* Add xz encoding related `pauli_to_xz`, `xz_to_pauli` and `pauli_prod` functions to the `ftqc` module.
  [(#7433)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7433)

* The transform `convert_to_mbqc_formalism` is added to the `ftqc` module to convert a circuit already
  expressed in a limited, compatible gate-set into the MBQC formalism. Circuits can be converted to the 
  relevant gate-set with the `convert_to_mbqc_gateset` transform.
  [(#7355)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7355)
  [(#7586)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7586)

* The `RotXZX` operation is added to the `ftqc` module to support definition of a universal
  gate-set that can be translated to the MBQC formalism.
  [(#7271)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7271)


<h4>Other improvements</h4>

* Caching with finite shots now always warns about the lack of expected noise.
  [(#7644)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7644)

* `cache` now defaults to `"auto"` with `qml.execute`, matching the behavior of `QNode` and reducing the 
  performance cost of using `qml.execute` for standard executions.
  [(#7644)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7644)

* `qml.grad` and `qml.jacobian` can now handle inputs with dynamic shapes being captured into plxpr.
  [(#7544)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7544/)

* Improved the drawing of `GlobalPhase`, `ctrl(GlobalPhase)`, `Identity` and `ctrl(Identity)` operations.
  The labels are grouped together like for other multi-qubit operations, and the drawing
  no longer depends on the wires of `GlobalPhase` or `Identity`. Control nodes of controlled global phases
  and identities no longer receive the operator label, which is in line with other controlled operations.
  [(#7457)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7457)

* The decomposition of `qml.PCPhase` is now significantly more efficient for more than 2 qubits.
  [(#7166)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7166)

* The decomposition of :class:`~.IntegerComparator` is now significantly more efficient.
  [(#7636)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7636)

* :class:`~.QubitUnitary` now supports a decomposition that is compatible with an arbitrary number of qubits. 
  This represents a fundamental improvement over the previous implementation, which was limited to two-qubit systems.
  [(#7277)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7277)

* Setting up the configuration of a workflow, including the determination of the best diff
  method, is now done *after* user transforms have been applied. This allows transforms to
  update the shots and change measurement processes with fewer issues.
  [(#7358)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7358)

* The decomposition of `DiagonalQubitUnitary` has been updated to a recursive decomposition
  into a smaller `DiagonalQubitUnitary` and a `SelectPauliRot` operation. This is a known
  decomposition [Theorem 7 in Shende et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406176)
  that contains fewer gates than the previous decomposition.
  [(#7370)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7370)

* An xDSL `qml.compiler.python_compiler.transforms.MergeRotationsPass` pass for applying `merge_rotations` to an
  xDSL module has been added for the experimental xDSL Python compiler integration.
  [(#7364)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7364)
  [(#7595)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7595)
  [(#7664)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7664)

* An xDSL `qml.compiler.python_compiler.transforms.IterativeCancelInversesPass` pass for applying `cancel_inverses`
  iteratively to an xDSL module has been added for the experimental xDSL Python compiler integration. This pass is
  optimized to cancel self-inverse operations iteratively to cancel nested self-inverse operations.
  [(#7364)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7364)
  [(#7595)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7595)
 
* An experimental integration for a Python compiler using [xDSL](https://xdsl.dev/index) has been introduced.
  This is similar to [Catalyst's MLIR dialects](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/stable/dev/dialects.html#mlir-dialects-in-catalyst), 
  but it is coded in Python instead of C++.

  [(#6919)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6919)
  [(#7299)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7299)

* The :func:`~.transforms.cancel_inverses` transform no longer changes the order of operations that don't have shared wires, providing a deterministic output.
  [(#7328)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7328)

* Alias for Identity (`I`) is now accessible from `qml.ops`.
  [(#7200)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7200)
  
* Adds a new `allocation` module containing `allocate` and `deallocate` instructions for requesting dynamic wires. This is currently
  experimental and not integrated.
  [(#7704)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7704)
  [(#7710)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7710)

* Computing the angles for uniformly controlled rotations, used in :class:`~.MottonenStatePreparation`
  and :class:`~.SelectPauliRot`, now takes much less computational effort and memory.
  [(#7377)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7377)

* Classical shadows with mixed quantum states are now computed with a dedicated method that uses an
  iterative algorithm similar to the handling of shadows with state vectors. This makes shadows with density 
  matrices much more performant.
  [(#6748)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6748)
  [(#7458)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7458)

* Two new functions called :func:`~.math.convert_to_su2` and :func:`~.math.convert_to_su4` have been added to `qml.math`, which convert unitary matrices to SU(2) or SU(4), respectively, and optionally a global phase.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

* `Operator.num_wires` now defaults to `None` to indicate that the operator can be on
  any number of wires.
  [(#7312)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7312)

* Shots can now be overridden for specific `qml.Snapshot` instances via a `shots` keyword argument.
  [(#7326)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7326)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2, shots=10)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.Snapshot("sample", measurement=qml.sample(qml.X(0)), shots=5)
      return qml.sample(qml.X(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.snapshots(circuit)()
  {'sample': array([-1., -1., -1., -1., -1.]),
   'execution_results': array([ 1., -1., -1., -1., -1.,  1., -1., -1.,  1., -1.])}
  ```

* PennyLane no longer validates that an operation has at least one wire, as having this check required the abstract
  interface to maintain a list of special implementations.
  [(#7327)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7327)

* Two new device-developer transforms have been added to `devices.preprocess`: 
  :func:`~.devices.preprocess.measurements_from_counts` and :func:`~.devices.preprocess.measurements_from_samples`.
  These transforms modify the tape to instead contain a `counts` or `sample` measurement process, 
  deriving the original measurements from the raw counts/samples in post-processing. This allows 
  expanded measurement support for devices that only 
  support counts/samples at execution, like real hardware devices.
  [(#7317)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7317)

* Sphinx version was updated to 8.1. Sphinx is upgraded to version 8.1 and uses Python 3.10. References to intersphinx (e.g. `<demos/>` or `<catalyst/>` are updated to remove the :doc: prefix that is incompatible with sphinx 8.1. 
  [(7212)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7212)

* Migrated `setup.py` package build and install to `pyproject.toml`
  [(#7375)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7375)

* Updated GitHub Actions workflows (`rtd.yml`, `readthedocs.yml`, and `docs.yml`) to use `ubuntu-24.04` runners.
 [(#7396)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7396)

* Updated requirements and pyproject files to include the other package.  
  [(#7417)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7417)

* Updated documentation check to remove duplicate docstring references. [(#7453)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7453)

<h3>Labs: a place for unified and rapid prototyping of research software üß™</h3>

* The imports of dependencies introduced by ``labs`` functionalities have been modified such that
  these dependencies only have to be installed for the functions that use them, not to use
  ``labs`` functionalities in general. This decouples the various submodules, and even functions
  within the same submodule, from each other.
  [(#7650)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7650)

* A new module :mod:`pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps <pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps>`
  provides functionality to compute intermediate representations for particular circuits.
  :func:`parity_matrix <pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps.parity_matrix>` computes
  the parity matrix intermediate representation for CNOT circuits.
  :func:`phase_polynomial <pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps.phase_polynomial>` computes
  the phase polynomial intermediate representation for {CNOT, RZ} circuits.
  These efficient intermediate representations are important
  for CNOT routing algorithms and other quantum compilation routines.

  to perform multiprocess and multithreaded execution of workloads. 
  [(#7401)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7401)

* A `rowcol` function is now available in `pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps`.
  Given the parity matrix of a CNOT circuit and a qubit connectivity graph, it synthesizes a
  possible implementation of the parity matrix that respects the connectivity.
  [(#7394)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7394)

* `pennylane.labs.QubitManager`, `pennylane.labs.AllocWires`, and `pennylane.labs.FreeWires` classes have been added to track and manage auxilliary qubits.

  [(#7725)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7725)

* A new module :mod:`pennylane.labs.zxopt <pennylane.labs.zxopt>` provides access to the basic optimization
  passes from [pyzx](https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for PennyLane circuits.
  
    * :func:`basic_optimization <pennylane.labs.zxopt.basic_optimization>` performs peephole optimizations on the circuit and is a useful subroutine for other optimization passes.

  new `gradient_kwargs` keyword argument accordingly.
  [(#7648)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7648)

* The default value of `cache` is now `"auto"` with `qml.execute`. Like `QNode`, `"auto"` only turns on caching
  when `max_diff > 1`.
  [(#7644)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7644)

* A new decomposition for two-qubit unitaries was implemented in `two_qubit_decomposition`.
  It ensures the correctness of the decomposition in some edge cases but uses 3 CNOT gates
  even if 2 CNOTs would suffice theoretically.
  [(#7474)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7474)

* The `return_type` property of `MeasurementProcess` has been removed. Please use `isinstance` for type checking instead.
  [(#7322)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7322)

* The `KerasLayer` class in `qml.qnn.keras` has been removed because Keras 2 is no longer actively maintained.

  [(#7307)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7307)

* The `control_wires` argument in `qml.ControlledQubitUnitary` has been removed.
  Furthermore, the `ControlledQubitUnitary` no longer accepts `QubitUnitary` objects as arguments as its `base`.

* Top-level access to `DeviceError`, `PennyLaneDeprecationWarning`, `QuantumFunctionError` and `ExperimentalWarning` have been deprecated and will be removed in v0.43. Please import them from the new `exceptions` module.
  [(#7292)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7292)
  [(#7477)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7477)
  [(#7508)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7508)
  [(#7603)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7603)

* `qml.operation.Observable` and the corresponding `Observable.compare` have been deprecated, as
  pennylane now depends on the more general `Operator` interface instead. The
  `Operator.is_hermitian` property can instead be used to check whether or not it is highly likely
  that the operator instance is Hermitian.
  [(#7316)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7316)

* The boolean functions provided in `pennylane.operation` are deprecated. See the :doc:`deprecations page </development/deprecations>` 
  for equivalent code to use instead. These include `not_tape`, `has_gen`, `has_grad_method`, `has_multipar`,
  `has_nopar`, `has_unitary_gen`, `is_measurement`, `defines_diagonalizing_gates`, and `gen_is_multi_term_hamiltonian`.
  [(#7319)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7319)

* `qml.operation.WiresEnum`, `qml.operation.AllWires`, and `qml.operation.AnyWires` are deprecated. To indicate that
  an operator can act on any number of wires, `Operator.num_wires = None` should be used instead. This is the default
  and does not need to be overwritten unless the operator developer wants to add wire number validation.
  [(#7313)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7313)

* The :func:`qml.QNode.get_gradient_fn` method is now deprecated. Instead, use :func:`~.workflow.get_best_diff_method` to obtain the differentiation method.
  [(#7323)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7323)

  [(#7475)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7475)

* Add `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file to the PennyLane repository. This file will allow specifying commits that should
  be ignored in the output of `git blame`. For example, this can be useful when a single commit includes bulk reformatting.
  [(#7507)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7507)

  [(#7372)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7372)
  [(#7392)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7392)

* A new internal module, `qml.concurrency`, is added to support internal use of multiprocess and multithreaded execution of workloads. This also migrates the use of `concurrent.futures` in `default.qubit` to this new design.
  [(#7303)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7303)

* Test suites in `tests/transforms/test_defer_measurement.py` use analytic mocker devices to test numeric results.

  [(#7292)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7292)

* Clean up `__init__.py` files in `math`, `ops`, `qaoa`, `tape` and `templates` to be explicit in what they import. 
  [(#7200)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7200)
  
* The `Tracker` class has been moved into the `devices` module.
  [(#7281)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7281)

* Moved functions that calculate rotation angles for unitary decompositions into an internal
  module `qml.math.decomposition`
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

* Fixed a failing integration test for `qml.QDrift`  which multiplied the operators of the decomposition incorrectly to evolve the state.
  [(#7621)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7621)

* The decomposition test in `assert_valid` no longer checks the matrix of the decomposition if the operator
  does not define a matrix representation.
  [(#7655)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7655)

<h3>Documentation üìù</h3>

* The functions in `qml.qchem.vibrational` are updated to include additional information about the 
  theory and input arguments.
  [(#6918)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6918)

* The usage examples for `qml.decomposition.DecompositionGraph` have been updated.
  [(#7692)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7692)

* The entry in the :doc:`/news/program_capture_sharp_bits` has been updated to include
  additional supported lightning devices: `lightning.kokkos` and `lightning.gpu`.
  [(#7674)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7674)

* Updated the circuit drawing for `qml.Select` to include two commonly used symbols for 
  Select-applying, or multiplexing, an operator. Added a similar drawing for `qml.SelectPauliRot`.
  [(#7464)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7464)
  
* The entry in the :doc:`/news/program_capture_sharp_bits` page for transforms has been updated; non-native transforms being applied
  to QNodes wherein operators have dynamic wires can lead to incorrect results.
  [(#7426)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7426)

* Fixed the wrong `theta` to `phi` in :class:`~pennylane.IsingXY`.
  [(#7427)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7427)

* In the :doc:`/introduction/compiling_circuits` page, in the "Decomposition in stages" section,
  circuit drawings now render in a way that's easier to read.
  [(#7419)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7419)

* The entry in the :doc:`/news/program_capture_sharp_bits` page for using program capture with Catalyst 
  has been updated. Instead of using ``qjit(experimental_capture=True)``, Catalyst is now compatible 
  with the global toggles ``qml.capture.enable()`` and ``qml.capture.disable()`` for enabling and
  disabling program capture.
  [(#7298)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7298)

* Added a warning to the documentation for `qml.snapshots` and `qml.Snapshot`, clarifying that compilation transforms 
may move operations across a `Snapshot`.
  [(#7746)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7746)

* In the :doc:`/development/guide/documentation` page, removed references to the outdated Sphinx and unsupported Python 3.8 version. 
  This helps ensure contributors follow current standards and avoid compatibility issues.
  [(#7479)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7479)

<h3>Bug fixes üêõ</h3>

* Fixes `CircuitGraph.iterate_parametrized_layers`, and thus `metric_tensor`, when the same operation occurs multiple
  times in the circuit.
  [(#7757)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7757)

* Fixes a bug with transforms that require the classical Jacobian applied to QNodes, where only
  some arguments are trainable and an intermediate transform does not preserve trainability information.
  [(#7345)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7345)

* The `qml.ftqc.ParametricMidMeasureMP` class was unable to accept data from `jax.numpy.array` inputs
  when specifying the angle, due to the given hashing policy. The implementation was updated to ensure
  correct hashing behavior for `float`, `numpy.array`, and `jax.numpy.array` inputs.
  [(#7693)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7693)

* A bug in `qml.draw_mpl` for circuits with work wires has been fixed. The previously
  inconsistent mapping for these wires has been resolved, ensuring accurate assignment during
  drawing.
  [(#7668)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7668)

* A bug in `ops.op_math.Prod.simplify()` has been fixed that led to global phases being discarded
  in special cases. Concretely, this problem occurs when Pauli factors combine into the identity
  up to a global phase _and_ there is no Pauli representation of the product operator.
  [(#7671)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7671)

* The behaviour of the `qml.FlipSign` operation has been fixed: passing an integer `m` as the wires argument is now
  interpreted as a single wire (i.e. `wires=[m]`). This is different from the previous interpretation of `wires=range(m)`.
  Also, the `qml.FlipSign.wires` attribute is now returning the correct `Wires` object as for all other operations in PennyLane.
  [(#7647)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7647)

* `qml.equal` now works with `qml.PauliError`s.
  [(#7618)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7618)

* The `qml.transforms.cancel_inverses` transform can be used with `jax.jit`.
  [(#7487)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7487)

* `qml.StatePrep` does not validate the norm of statevectors any more, default to `False` during initialization.
  [(#7615)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7615)

* `qml.PhaseShift` operation is now working correctly with a batch size of 1.
  [(#7622)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7622)

* `qml.metric_tensor` can now be calculated with catalyst.
  [(#7528)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7528)

* The mapping to standard wires (consecutive integers) of `qml.tape.QuantumScript` has been fixed
  to correctly consider work wires that are not used otherwise in the circuit.
  [(#7581)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7581)

* Fixed a bug where certain transforms with a native program capture implementation give incorrect results when
  dynamic wires were present in the circuit. The affected transforms were:
  * :func:`~pennylane.transforms.cancel_inverses`
  * :func:`~pennylane.transforms.merge_rotations`
  * :func:`~pennylane.transforms.single_qubit_fusion`
  * :func:`~pennylane.transforms.merge_amplitude_embedding`
  [(#7426)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7426)

* The `Operator.pow` method has been fixed to raise to the power of 2 the qutrit operators `~.TShift`, `~.TClock`, and `~.TAdd`.
  [(#7505)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7505)

* The queuing behavior of the controlled of a controlled operation is fixed.
  [(#7532)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7532)

* A new decomposition was implemented for two-qubit `QubitUnitary` operators in `two_qubit_decomposition`
  based on a type-AI Cartan decomposition. It fixes previously faulty edge cases for unitaries
  that require 2 or 3 CNOT gates. Now, 3 CNOTs are used for both cases, using one more
  CNOT than theoretically required in the former case.
  [(#7474)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7474)

* The documentation of `qml.pulse.drive` has been updated and corrected.
  [(#7459)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7459)

* Fixed a bug in `to_openfermion` where identity qubit-to-wires mapping was not obeyed.
  [(#7332)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7332)

* Fixed a bug in the validation of :class:`~.SelectPauliRot` that prevents parameter broadcasting.
  [(#7377)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7377)

* Usage of NumPy in `default.mixed` source code has been converted to `qml.math` to avoid
  unnecessary dependency on NumPy and to fix a bug that caused an error when using `default.mixed` with PyTorch and GPUs.
  [(#7384)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7384)

* With program capture enabled (`qml.capture.enable()`), `QSVT` no treats abstract values as metadata.
  [(#7360)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7360)

* A fix was made to `default.qubit` to allow for using `qml.Snapshot` with defer-measurements (`mcm_method="deferred"`).
  [(#7335)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7335)

* Fixes the repr for empty `Prod` and `Sum` instances to better communicate the existence of an empty instance.
  [(#7346)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7346)

* Fixes a bug where circuit execution fails with ``BlockEncode`` initialized with sparse matrices.
  [(#7285)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7285)

* Adds an informative error if `qml.cond` is used with an abstract condition with
  jitting on `default.qubit` if capture is enabled.
  [(#7314)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7314)

* Fixes a bug where using a ``StatePrep`` operation with `batch_size=1` did not work with ``default.mixed``.
  [(#7280)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7280)

* Gradient transforms can now be used in conjunction with batch transforms with all interfaces.
  [(#7287)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7287)

* Fixes a bug where the global phase was not being added in the ``QubitUnitary`` decomposition.  
  [(#7244)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7244)
  [(#7270)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7270)

* Using finite differences with program capture without x64 mode enabled now raises a warning.
  [(#7282)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7282)

* When the `mcm_method` is specified to the `"device"`, the `defer_measurements` transform will 
  no longer be applied. Instead, the device will be responsible for all MCM handling.
  [(#7243)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7243)

* Fixed coverage of `qml.liealg.CII` and `qml.liealg.AIII`.
  [(#7291)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7291)

* Fixed a bug where the phase is used as the wire label for a `qml.GlobalPhase` when capture is enabled.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

* Fixed a bug that caused `CountsMP.process_counts` to return results in the computational basis, even if
  an observable was specified.
  [(#7342)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7342)

* Fixed a bug that caused `SamplesMP.process_counts` used with an observable to return a list of eigenvalues 
  for each individual operation in the observable, instead of the overall result.
  [(#7342)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7342)

* Fixed a bug where `two_qubit_decomposition` provides an incorrect decomposition for some special matrices.
  [(#7340)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7340)

* Fixes a bug where the powers of `qml.ISWAP` and `qml.SISWAP` were decomposed incorrectly.
  [(#7361)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7361)

* Returning `MeasurementValue`s from the `ftqc` module's parametric mid-circuit measurements
  (`measure_arbitrary_basis`, `measure_x` and `measure_y`) no longer raises an error in circuits 
  using `diagonalize_mcms`.
  [(#7387)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7387)

* Fixes a bug where the :func:`~.transforms.single_qubit_fusion` transform produces a tape that is
  off from the original tape by a global phase.
  [(#7619)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7619)

* Updated documentation for mid-circuit measurements using the Tree Traversal algorithm
  to reflect supported devices and usage in analytic simulations,
  in the :doc:`/introduction/dynamic_quantum_circuits` page.
  [(#7691)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7691)
