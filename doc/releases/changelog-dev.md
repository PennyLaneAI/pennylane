# Release 0.31.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements üõ†</h3>

* Accelerate Jordan-Wigner transforms caching Pauli gate objects.
  [(4046)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4046)

* The `qchem.molecular_hamiltonian` function is upgraded to support custom wires for constructing
  differentiable Hamiltonians. The zero imaginary component of the Hamiltonian coefficients are
  removed.
  [(4050)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4050)
  [(4094)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4094)

* An error is now raised by `qchem.molecular_hamiltonian` when the `dhf` method is used for an 
  open-shell system. This duplicates a similar error in `qchem.Molecule` but makes it easier to
  inform the users that the `pyscf` backend can be used for open-shell calculations.
  [(4058)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4058)

* Added a `shots` property to `QuantumScript`. This will allow shots to be tied to executions instead of devices more
  concretely.
  [(#4067)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4067)
  [(#4103)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4103)
  [(#4106)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4106)
  [(#4112)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4112)

* `qml.specs` is compatible with custom operations that have `depth` bigger than 1.
  [(#4033)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4033)

* `qml.prod` now accepts a single qfunc input for creating new `Prod` operators.
  [(#4011)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4011)

* Added `__repr__` and `__str__` methods to the `Shots` class.
  [(#4081)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4081)

* Added `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods to the `Shots` class.
  [(#4082)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4082)

* Added a function `measure_with_samples` that returns a sample-based measurement result given a state
  [(#4083)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4083)
  [(#4093)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4093)

* Wrap all objects being queued in an `AnnotatedQueue` so that `AnnotatedQueue` is not dependent on
  the hash of any operators/measurement processes.
  [(#4087)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4087)

* Support for adjoint differentiation has been added to the `DefaultQubit2` device.
  [(#4037)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4037)

* Support for sample-based measurements has been added to the `DefaultQubit2` device.
  [(#4105)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4105)

* Added a `dense` keyword to `ParametrizedEvolution` that allows forcing dense or sparse matrices.
  [(#4079)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4079)
  [(#4095)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4095)

* `qml.devices.ExecutionConfig` no longer has a `shots` property, as it is now on the `QuantumScript`.  It now has a `use_device_gradient` property. `ExecutionConfig.grad_on_execution = None` indicates a request for `"best"`, instead of a string.
[(#4102)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4102)

* `DefaultQubit2.preprocess` now returns a new `ExecutionConfig` object with decisions for `gradient_method`,
  `use_device_gradient`, and `grad_on_execution`.
  [(#4102)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4102)


<h3>Breaking changes üíî</h3>

* The experimental Device interface `qml.devices.experimental.Device` now requires that the `preprocess` method
  also returns an `ExecutionConfig` object. This allows the device to choose what `"best"` means for various
  hyperparameters like `gradient_method` and `grad_on_execution`.
  [(#4007)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4007)
  [(#4102)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4102)

* Gradient transforms with Jax do not support `argnum` anymore,  `argnums` needs to be used.
  [(#4076)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4076)

* `pennylane.collections`, `pennylane.op_sum`, and `pennylane.utils.sparse_hamiltonian` are removed.

<h3>Deprecations üëã</h3>

<h3>Documentation üìù</h3>

* The description of `mult` in the `qchem.Molecule` docstring now correctly states the value
  of `mult` that is supported.
  [(4058)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4058)

<h3>Bug fixes üêõ</h3>

* Removes a patch in `interfaces/autograd.py` that checks for the `strawberryfields.gbs` device.  That device
  is pinned to PennyLane <= v0.29.0, so that patch is no longer necessary.
