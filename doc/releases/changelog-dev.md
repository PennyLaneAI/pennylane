# Release 0.23.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Development of a circuit-cutting compiler extension to circuits with sampling
  measurements has begun:

  - The existing `qcut.tape_to_graph()` method has been extended to convert a
    sample measurement without an observable specified to multiple single-qubit sample
    nodes.
    [(#2313)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2313)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* The function `qml.eigvals` is modified to use the efficient `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh`
  method for obtaining the eigenvalues of a `SparseHamiltonian`. This new addition is used 
  to compute :math:`k` eigenvalues of a sparse :math:`N \times N` matrix if `k` is smaller
  than :math:`N-1`. If a larger :math:`k` is requested, the dense matrix representation of 
  the Hamiltonian is constructed and the regular `qml.math.linalg.eigvalsh` is applied.
  [(#2333)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2333)

* The function `qml.ctrl` was given the optional argument `control_values=None`.
  If overridden, `control_values` takes an integer or a list of integers corresponding to
  the binary value that each control value should take. The same change is reflected in
  `ControlledOperation`. Control values of `0` are implemented by `qml.PauliX` applied
  before and after the controlled operation
  [(#2288)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2288)

* Circuit cutting now performs expansion to search for wire cuts in contained operations or tapes.
  [(#2340)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2340)

<h3>Deprecations</h3>

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* The `ObservableReturnTypes` `Sample`, `Variance`, `Expectation`, `Probability`, `State`, and `MidMeasure`
  have been moved to `measurements` from `operation`.
  [(#2329)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2329)

* The deprecated QNode, available via `qml.qnode_old.QNode`, has been removed. Please
  transition to using the standard `qml.QNode`.
  [(#2336)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2336)

* The deprecated, non-batch compatible interfaces, have been removed.
  [(#2336)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2336)

* The deprecated tape subclasses `QubitParamShiftTape`, `JacobianTape`, `CVParamShiftTape`, and
  `ReversibleTape` have been removed.
