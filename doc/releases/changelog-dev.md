# Release 0.40.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>
  
* A `DeviceCapabilities` data class is defined to contain all capabilities of the device's execution interface (i.e. its implementation of `Device.execute`). A TOML file can be used to define the capabilities of a device, and it can be loaded into a `DeviceCapabilities` object.
  [(#6407)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6407)

  ```pycon
  >>> from pennylane.devices.capabilities import load_toml_file, parse_toml_document, DeviceCapabilities
  >>> document = load_toml_file("my_device.toml")
  >>> capabilities = parse_toml_document(document)
  >>> isinstance(capabilities, DeviceCapabilities)
  True
  ```

* Added a dense implementation of computing the Lie closure in a new function
  `lie_closure_dense` in `pennylane.labs.dla`.
  [(#6371)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6371)

<h4>New API for Qubit Mixed</h4>

* Added `qml.devices.qubit_mixed` module for mixed-state qubit device support [(#6379)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6379). This module introduces an `apply_operation` helper function that features:

  * Two density matrix contraction methods using `einsum` and `tensordot`

  * Optimized handling of special cases including: Diagonal operators, Identity operators, CX (controlled-X), Multi-controlled X gates, Grover operators

* Added submodule 'initialize_state' featuring a `create_initial_state` function for initializing a density matrix from `qml.StatePrep` operations or `qml.QubitDensityMatrix` operations.
  [(#6503)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6503)

* Added a second class `DefaultMixedNewAPI` to the `qml.devices.qubit_mixed` module, which is to be the replacement of legacy `DefaultMixed` which for now to hold the implementations of `preprocess` and `execute` methods.
  [(#6607)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6507)

<h3>Improvements üõ†</h3>

* Added support for the `wire_options` dictionary to customize wire line formatting in `qml.draw_mpl` circuit
  visualizations, allowing global and per-wire customization with options like `color`, `linestyle`, and `linewidth`.
  [(#6486)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6486)

* Shortened the string representation for the `qml.S`, `qml.T`, and `qml.SX` operators.
  [(#6542)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6542)

* Added functions and dunder methods to add and multiply Resources objects in series and in parallel.
  [(#6567)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6567)

<h4>Capturing and representing hybrid programs</h4>

* `jax.vmap` can be captured with `qml.capture.make_plxpr` and is compatible with quantum circuits. 
  [(#6349)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6349)
  [(#6422)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6422)

* `qml.capture.PlxprInterpreter` base class has been added for easy transformation and execution of
  pennylane variant jaxpr.
  [(#6141)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6141)

* A `DefaultQubitInterpreter` class has been added to provide plxpr execution using python based tools,
  and the `DefaultQubit.eval_jaxpr` method is now implemented.
  [(#6594)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6594)
  [(#6328)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6328)

* An optional method `eval_jaxpr` is added to the device API for native execution of plxpr programs.
  [(#6580)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6580)

* `qml.capture.qnode_call` has been made private and moved to the `workflow` module.
  [(#6620)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6620/)

<h4>Other Improvements</h4>

* `qml.BasisRotation` template is now JIT compatible.
  [(#6019)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6019)

* The Jaxpr primitives for `for_loop`, `while_loop` and `cond` now store slices instead of
  numbers of args.
  [(#6521)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6521)

* Expand `ExecutionConfig.gradient_method` to store `TransformDispatcher` type.
  [(#6455)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6455)

* Fix the string representation of `Resources` instances to match the attribute names.
  [(#6581)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6581)

<h3>Labs üß™</h3>

* Added base class `Resources`, `CompressedResourceOp`, `ResourceOperator` for advanced resource estimation.
  [(#6428)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6428)

* Added `ResourceOperator` classes for QFT and all operators in QFT's decomposition.
  [(#6447)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6447)

<h3>Breaking changes üíî</h3>

* `qml.math.jax_argnums_to_tape_trainable` is moved and made private to avoid a qnode dependency
  in the math module.
  [(#6609)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6609)

* Gradient transforms are now applied after the user's transform program.
  [(#6590)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6590)

  `qml.operation.enable_new_opmath`, `qml.operation.disable_new_opmath`, and `qml.operation.convert_to_legacy_H`.
  Note that `qml.Hamiltonian` will continue to dispatch to `qml.ops.LinearCombination`. For more information, 
  check out the [updated operator troubleshooting page](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/news/new_opmath.html).
  [(#6548)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6548)
  [(#6602)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6602)

* The developer-facing `qml.utils` module has been removed. Specifically, the
following 4 sets of functions have been either moved or removed[(#6588)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6588):

  * `qml.utils._flatten`, `qml.utils.unflatten` has been moved and renamed to `qml.optimize.qng._flatten_np` and `qml.optimize.qng._unflatten_np` respectively.

  * `qml.utils._inv_dict` and `qml._get_default_args` have been removed.

  modules instead.
  [(#6584)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6584)

* Top level access to `Device`, `QubitDevice`, and `QutritDevice` have been removed. Instead, they
  are available as `qml.devices.LegacyDevice`, `qml.devices.QubitDevice`, and `qml.devices.QutritDevice`
  respectively.
  [(#6537)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6537)

  [(#6534)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6534)

* `QNode.gradient_fn` has been removed. Please use `QNode.diff_method` instead. `QNode.get_gradient_fn` can also be used to
  process the diff method.

  to better align with the termionology used by the `QNode`.
