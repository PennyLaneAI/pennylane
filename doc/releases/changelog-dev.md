# Release 0.38.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Resolved the bug in `qml.ThermalRelaxationError` where there was a typo from `tq` to `tg`.
  [(#5988)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/issues/5988)

* A new method `process_density_matrix` has been added to the `ProbabilityMP` and `DensityMatrixMP` classes, allowing for more efficient handling of quantum density matrices, particularly with batch processing support. This method simplifies the calculation of probabilities from quantum states represented as density matrices.
  [(#5830)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5830)

* The `qml.PrepSelPrep` template is added. The template implements a block-encoding of a linear
  combination of unitaries.
  [(#5756)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5756)

* A new `qml.from_qiskit_noise` method now allows one to convert a Qiskit ``NoiseModel`` to a
  PennyLane ``NoiseModel`` via the Pennylane-Qiskit plugin.
  [(#5996)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5996)

* The `split_to_single_terms` transform is added. This transform splits expectation values of sums 
  into multiple single-term measurements on a single tape, providing better support for simulators
  that can handle non-commuting observables but don't natively support multi-term observables.
  [(#5884)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5884)

* `SProd.terms` now flattens out the terms if the base is a multi-term observable.
  [(#5885)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5885)

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

* `StateMP.process_state` defines rules in `cast_to_complex` for complex casting, avoiding a superfluous state vector copy in Lightning simulations
  [(#5995)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5995)

* Port the fast `apply_operation` implementation of `PauliZ` to `PhaseShift`, `S` and `T`.
  [(#5876)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5876)

* `qml.UCCSD` now accepts an additional optional argument, `n_repeats`, which defines the number of
  times the UCCSD template is repeated. This can improve the accuracy of the template by reducing
  the Trotter error but would result in deeper circuits.
  [(#5801)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5801)

* `QuantumScript.hash` is now cached, leading to performance improvements.
  [(#5919)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5919)

* The representation for `Wires` has now changed to be more copy-paste friendly.
  [(#5958)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5958)

* Observable validation for `default.qubit` is now based on execution mode (analytic vs. finite shots) and measurement type (sample measurement vs. state measurement).
  [(#5890)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5890)

* Molecules and Hamiltonians can now be constructed for all the elements present in the periodic table.
  [(#5821)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5821)

<h4>Community contributions 🥳</h4>

* `DefaultQutritMixed` readout error has been added using parameters `readout_relaxation_probs` and 
  `readout_misclassification_probs` on the `default.qutrit.mixed` device. These parameters add a `~.QutritAmplitudeDamping`  and a `~.TritFlip` channel, respectively,
  after measurement diagonalization. The amplitude damping error represents the potential for
  relaxation to occur during longer measurements. The trit flip error represents misclassification during readout.
  [(#5842)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5842)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* ``qml.from_qasm`` no longer removes measurements from the QASM code. Use 
  ``measurements=[]`` to remove measurements from the original circuit.
  [(#5982)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5982)
  
* ``qml.transforms.map_batch_transform`` has been removed, since transforms can be applied directly to a batch of tapes.
  See :func:`~.pennylane.transform` for more information.
  [(#5981)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5981)

* `QuantumScript.interface` has been removed.
  [(#5980)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5980)

<h3>Deprecations 👋</h3>

* `pennylane.qinfo.classical_fisher` and `pennylane.qinfo.quantum_fisher` have been deprecated.
  Instead, use `pennylane.gradients.classical_fisher` and `pennylane.gradients.quantum_fisher`.
  [(#5985)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5985)

<h3>Documentation 📝</h3>

* Improves the docstring for `QuantumScript.expand` and `qml.tape.tape.expand_tape`.
  [(#5974)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5974)

<h3>Bug fixes 🐛</h3>

* `qml.QSVT` is updated to store wire order correctly.
  [(#5959)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5959)

* `qml.devices.qubit.measure_with_samples` now returns the correct result if the provided measurements
  contain sum of operators acting on the same wire.
  [(#5978)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5978)

* `qml.AmplitudeEmbedding` has better support for features using low precision integer data types.
[(#5969)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5969)
