# Release 0.19.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* The transform for the Jacobian of the classical preprocessing within a QNode,
  `qml.transforms.classical_jacobian`, now takes a keyword argument `argnum` to specify
  the QNode argument indices with respect to which the Jacobian is computed.
  [(#1645)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1645)

  An example for the usage of ``argnum`` is

  ```python
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x, y, z):
      qml.RX(qml.math.sin(x), wires=0)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      qml.RY(y ** 2, wires=1)
      qml.RZ(1 / z, wires=1)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

  jac_fn = qml.transforms.classical_jacobian(circuit, argnum=[1, 2])
  ```

  The Jacobian can then be computed at specified parameters.

  ```pycon
  >>> x, y, z = np.array([0.1, -2.5, 0.71])
  >>> jac_fn(x, y, z)
  (array([-0., -5., -0.]), array([-0.        , -0.        , -1.98373339]))
  ```

  The returned arrays are the derivatives of the three parametrized gates in the circuit
  with respect to `y` and `z` respectively.

  There also are explicit tests for `classical_jacobian` now, which previously was tested
  implicitly via its use in the `metric_tensor` transform.

  For more usage details, please see the
  [classical Jacobian docstring](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/api/pennylane.transforms.classical_jacobian.html).

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* ``qml.circuit_drawer.CircuitDrawer`` can accept a string for the ``charset`` keyword, instead of a ``CharSet`` object.
