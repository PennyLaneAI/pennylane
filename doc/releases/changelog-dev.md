# Release 0.43.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* A new :func:`~.ops.op_math.change_basis_op` function and :class:`~.ops.op_math.ChangeOpBasis` class were added,
  which allow a compute-uncompute pattern (U V U†) to be represented by a single operator.
  A corresponding decomposition rule has been added to support efficiently controlling the pattern,
  in which only the central (target) operator is controlled, and not U or U†.
  [(#8023)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8023)
  [(#8070)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8070)

* A new keyword argument ``partial`` has been added to :class:`qml.Select`. It allows for 
  simplifications in the decomposition of ``Select`` under the assumption that the state of the
  control wires has no overlap with computational basis states that are not used by ``Select``.
  [(#7658)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7658)

* New ZX calculus-based transforms have been added to access circuit optimization
  passes implemented in [pyzx](https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

  * :func:`~.transforms.zx.push_hadamards` to optimize a phase-polynomial + Hadamard circuit by pushing
    Hadamard gates as far as possible to one side to create fewer larger phase-polynomial blocks
    (see [pyzx.basic_optimization](https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyzx.optimize.basic_optimization)).
    [(#8025)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8025)

  * :func:`~.transforms.zx.todd` to optimize a Clifford + T circuit by using the Third Order Duplicate and Destroy (TODD) algorithm
    (see [pyzx.phase_block_optimize](https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyzx.optimize.phase_block_optimize)).
    [(#8029)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8029)

  * :func:`~.transforms.zx.optimize_t_count` to reduce the number of T gates in a Clifford + T circuit by applying
    a sequence of passes that combine ZX-based commutation and cancellation rules and the TODD algorithm
    (see [pyzx.full_optimize](https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyzx.optimize.full_optimize)).
    [(#8088)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8088)

  * :func:`~.transforms.zx.reduce_non_clifford` to reduce the number of non-Clifford gates by applying
    a combination of phase gadgetization strategies and Clifford gate simplification rules.
    (see [pyzx.full_reduce](https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyzx.simplify.full_reduce)).
    [(#7747)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7747)

* The `qml.specs` function now accepts a `compute_depth` keyword argument, which is set to `True` by default.
  This makes the expensive depth computation performed by `qml.specs` optional.
  [(#7998)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7998)
  [(#8042)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8042)

* New transforms called :func:`~.transforms.match_relative_phase_toffoli` and 
  :func:`~.transforms.match_controlled_iX_gate` have been added to implement passes that make use
  of equivalencies to compile certain patterns to efficient Clifford+T equivalents.
  [(#7748)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7748)

* Leveraging quantum just-in-time compilation to optimize parameterized hybrid workflows with the momentum
  quantum natural gradient optimizer is now possible with the new :class:`~.MomentumQNGOptimizerQJIT` optimizer.
  [(#7606)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7606)

  Similar to the :class:`~.QNGOptimizerQJIT` optimizer, :class:`~.MomentumQNGOptimizerQJIT` offers a
  `qml.qjit`-compatible analogue to the existing :class:`~.MomentumQNGOptimizer` with an Optax-like interface:

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  import jax.numpy as jnp

  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(params):
      qml.RX(params[0], wires=0)
      qml.RY(params[1], wires=1)
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0) + qml.X(1))

  opt = qml.MomentumQNGOptimizerQJIT(stepsize=0.1, momentum=0.2)

  @qml.qjit
  def update_step_qjit(i, args):
      params, state = args
      return opt.step(circuit, params, state)

  @qml.qjit
  def optimization_qjit(params, iters):
      state = opt.init(params)
      args = (params, state)
      params, state = qml.for_loop(iters)(update_step_qjit)(args)
      return params
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> params = jnp.array([0.1, 0.2])
  >>> iters = 1000
  >>> optimization_qjit(params=params, iters=iters)
  Array([ 3.14159265, -1.57079633], dtype=float64)
  ```

* The :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform is now able to decompose classically controlled operations.
  [(#8145)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8145)

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

* A new keyword argument called ``shot_dist`` has been added to the :func:`~.transforms.split_non_commuting` transform.
  This allows for more customization and efficiency when calculating expectation values across the non-commuting groups
  of observables that make up a ``Hamiltonian``/``LinearCombination``.
  [(#7988)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7988)

  Given a QNode that returns a sample-based measurement (e.g., ``expval``) of a ``Hamiltonian``/``LinearCombination``
  with finite ``shots``, the current default behaviour of :func:`~.transforms.split_non_commuting` will perform ``shots``
  executions for each group of commuting terms. With the ``shot_dist`` argument, this behaviour can be changed:

  * ``"uniform"``: evenly distributes the number of ``shots`` across all groups of commuting terms
  * ``"weighted"``: distributes the number of ``shots`` according to weights proportional to the L1 norm of the coefficients in each group
  * ``"weighted_random"``: same as ``"weighted"``, but the numbers of ``shots`` are sampled from a multinomial distribution
  * or a user-defined function implementing a custom shot distribution strategy

  To show an example about how this works, let's start by defining a simple Hamiltonian:

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml

  ham = qml.Hamiltonian(
      coeffs=[10, 0.1, 20, 100, 0.2],
      observables=[
          qml.X(0) @ qml.Y(1),
          qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(2),
          qml.Y(1),
          qml.X(1) @ qml.X(2),
          qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(1) @ qml.Z(2)
      ]
  )
  ```

  This Hamiltonian can be split into 3 non-commuting groups of mutually commuting terms.
  With ``shot_dist = "weighted"``, for example, the number of shots will be divided
  according to the L1 norm of each group's coefficients:

  ```python
  from functools import partial
  from pennylane.transforms import split_non_commuting

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

  @partial(split_non_commuting, shot_dist="weighted")
  @qml.qnode(dev, shots=10000)
  def circuit():
      return qml.expval(ham)

  with qml.Tracker(dev) as tracker:
      circuit()
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(tracker.history["shots"])
  [2303, 23, 7674]
  ```

* The number of `shots` can now be specified directly in QNodes as a standard keyword argument.
  [(#8073)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8073)

  ```python
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"), shots=1000)
  def circuit():
      qml.H(0)
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit.shots
  Shots(total=1000)
  >>> circuit()
  np.float64(-0.004)
  ```

  Setting the `shots` value in a QNode is equivalent to decorating with :func:`qml.workflow.set_shots`. Note, however, that decorating with :func:`qml.workflow.set_shots` overrides QNode `shots`:

  ```pycon
  >>> new_circ = qml.set_shots(circuit, shots=123)
  >>> new_circ.shots
  Shots(total=123)
  ```

* PennyLane `autograph` supports standard python for updating arrays like `array[i] += x` instead of jax `arr.at[i].add(x)`. 
  Users can now use this when designing quantum circuits with experimental program capture enabled.

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  import jax.numpy as jnp

  qml.capture.enable()

  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3))
  def circuit(val):
    angles = jnp.zeros(3)
    angles[0:3] += val

    for i, angle in enumerate(angles):
        qml.RX(angle, i)

    return qml.expval(qml.Z(0)), qml.expval(qml.Z(1)), qml.expval(qml.Z(2))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(jnp.pi)
  (Array(-1, dtype=float32),
   Array(-1, dtype=float32),
   Array(-1, dtype=float32)) 
  ```

  [(#8076)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8076)

* PennyLane `autograph` supports standard python for index assignment (`arr[i] = x`) instead of jax.numpy form (`arr = arr.at[i].set(x)`).
  Users can now use standard python assignment when designing circuits with experimental program capture enabled.

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  import jax.numpy as jnp

  qml.capture.enable()

  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3))
  def circuit(val):
    angles = jnp.zeros(3)
    angles[1] = val / 2
    angles[2] = val

    for i, angle in enumerate(angles):
        qml.RX(angle, i)

    return qml.expval(qml.Z(0)), qml.expval(qml.Z(1)), qml.expval(qml.Z(2))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(jnp.pi)
  (Array(0.99999994, dtype=float32),
   Array(0., dtype=float32),
   Array(-0.99999994, dtype=float32)) 
  ```

  [(#8027)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8027)

* Logical operations (`and`, `or` and `not`) are now supported with the `autograph` module. Users can
  now use these logical operations in control flow when designing quantum circuits with experimental
  program capture enabled.

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml

  qml.capture.enable()

  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit", wires=1))
  def circuit(param):
      if param >= 0 and param <= 1:
          qml.H(0)
      return qml.state()
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(0.5)
  Array([0.70710677+0.j, 0.70710677+0.j], dtype=complex64)
  ```

  [(#8006)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8006)

* The decomposition of :class:`~.BasisRotation` has been optimized to skip redundant phase shift gates
  with angle :math:`\pm \pi` for real-valued, i.e., orthogonal, rotation matrices. This uses the fact that
  no or single :class:`~.PhaseShift` gate is required in case the matrix has a determinant :math:`\pm 1`.
  [(#7765)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7765)

* Changed how basis states are assigned internally in `qml.Superposition`, improving its
  decomposition slightly both regarding classical computing time and gate decomposition.
  [(#7880)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7880)

* The printing and drawing of :class:`~.TemporaryAND`, also known as ``qml.Elbow``, and its adjoint
  have been improved to be more legible and consistent with how it's depicted in circuits in the literature.
  [(#8017)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8017)

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml

  @qml.draw
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=4))
  def node():
      qml.TemporaryAND([0, 1, 2], control_values=[1, 0])
      qml.CNOT([2, 3])
      qml.adjoint(qml.TemporaryAND([0, 1, 2], control_values=[1, 0]))
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(3))
  ```

  ```pycon
  print(node())
  0: ─╭●─────●╮─┤     
  1: ─├○─────○┤─┤     
  2: ─╰──╭●───╯─┤     
  3: ────╰X─────┤  <Z>
  ```

* Several templates now have decompositions that can be accessed within the graph-based
  decomposition system (:func:`~.decomposition.enable_graph`), allowing workflows
  that include these templates to be decomposed in a resource-efficient and performant
  manner.

* A new function called :func:`~.math.choi_matrix` is available, which computes the [Choi matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choi%E2%80%93Jamio%C5%82kowski_isomorphism) of a quantum channel.
  This is a useful tool in quantum information science and to check circuit identities involving non-unitary operations.

* A new device preprocess transform, `~.devices.preprocess.no_analytic`, is available for hardware devices and hardware-like simulators.
  It validates that all executions are shot-based.
  [(#8037)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8037)

* With program capture, the `true_fn` can now be a subclass of `Operator` when no `false_fn` is provided.
  `qml.cond(condition, qml.X)(0)` is now valid code and will return nothing, even though `qml.X` is
  technically a callable that returns an `X` operator.
  [(#8060)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8060)
  [(#8101)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8101)

* With program capture, an error is now raised if the conditional predicate is not a scalar.
  [(#8066)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8066)

<h4>OpenQASM-PennyLane interoperability</h4>

* The :func:`qml.from_qasm3` function can now convert OpenQASM 3.0 circuits that contain
  subroutines, constants, all remaining stdlib gates, qubit registers, and built-in mathematical functions.

  [(#7652)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7652)

* Added a callback mechanism to the `qml.compiler.python_compiler` submodule to inspect the intermediate 
  representation of the program between multiple compilation passes.
  [(#7964)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7964)

* The matrix factorization using :func:`~.math.decomposition.givens_decomposition` has
  been optimized to factor out the redundant sign in the diagonal phase matrix for the
  real-valued (orthogonal) rotation matrices. For example, in case the determinant of a matrix is
  :math:`-1`, only a single element of the phase matrix is required.
  [(#7765)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7765)

* Added the `NumQubitsOp` operation to the `Quantum` dialect of the Python compiler.
[(#8063)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8063)

  [(#7847)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7847)

* A compilation pass written with xDSL called `qml.compiler.python_compiler.transforms.MeasurementsFromSamplesPass`
  has been added for the experimental xDSL Python compiler integration. This pass replaces all
  terminal measurements in a program with a single :func:`pennylane.sample` measurement, and adds
  postprocessing instructions to recover the original measurement.
  [(#7620)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7620)

* A combine-global-phase pass has been added to the xDSL Python compiler integration.
  Note that the current implementation can only combine all the global phase operations at
  the last global phase operation in the same region. In other words, global phase operations inside a control flow region can't be combined with those in their parent
  region.

* The :func:`~.clifford_t_decomposition` transform can now handle circuits with mid-circuit
  measurements including Catalyst's measurements operations. It also now handles `RZ` and `PhaseShift`
  operations where angles are odd multiples of `±pi/4` more efficiently while using `method="gridsynth"`.

  [(#7968)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7968)

<h4>Resource-efficient decompositions 🔎</h4>

* With :func:`~.decomposition.enable_graph()`, dynamically allocated wires are now supported in decomposition rules. This provides a smoother overall experience when decomposing operators in a way that requires auxiliary/work wires.
  [(#7861)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7861)

  * The :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform now accepts a `num_available_work_wires` argument that allows the user to specify the number of work wires available for dynamic allocation.

  [(#8024)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8024)

* A :class:`~.decomposition.decomposition_graph.DecompGraphSolution` class is added to store the solution of a decomposition graph. An instance of this class is returned from the `solve` method of the :class:`~.decomposition.decomposition_graph.DecompositionGraph`.
  [(#8031)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8031)

  StableHLO dialect with missing upstream operations.
  [(#8036)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8036)
  [(#8084)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8084)
  

* Added more templates with state of the art resource estimates. Users can now use the `ResourceQPE`,
  `ResourceControlledSequence`, and `ResourceIterativeQPE` templates with the resource estimation tool.
  [(#8053)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8053)

* Added state of the art resources for the `ResourceTrotterProduct` template.
  [(#7910)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7910)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* The methods :meth:`~.pauli.PauliWord.operation` and :meth:`~.pauli.PauliSentence.operation`
  no longer queue any operators.
  [(#8136)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8136)

* `qml.sample` no longer has singleton dimensions squeezed out for single shots or single wires. This cuts
  down on the complexity of post-processing due to having to handle single shot and single wire cases
  separately. The return shape will now *always* be `(shots, num_wires)`.
  [(#7944)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7944)
  [(#8118)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8118)

  For a simple qnode:

  ```pycon
  >>> @qml.qnode(qml.device('default.qubit'))
  ... def c():
  ...   return qml.sample(wires=0)
  ```

  Before the change, we had:
  
  ```pycon
  >>> qml.set_shots(c, shots=1)()
  0
  ```

  and now we have:

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.set_shots(c, shots=1)()
  array([[0]])
  ```

  Previous behavior can be recovered by squeezing the output:

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.math.squeeze(qml.set_shots(c, shots=1)())
  0
  ```

* `ExecutionConfig` and `MCMConfig` from `pennylane.devices` are now frozen dataclasses whose fields should be updated with `dataclass.replace`. 
  [(#7697)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7697)
  [(#8046)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8046)

* Functions involving an execution configuration will now default to `None` instead of `pennylane.devices.DefaultExecutionConfig` and have to be handled accordingly. 
  This prevents the potential mutation of a global object. 

  This means that functions like,
  ```python
  ...
    def some_func(..., execution_config = DefaultExecutionConfig):
      ...
  ...
  ```
  should be written as follows,
  ```python
  ...
    def some_func(..., execution_config: ExecutionConfig | None = None):
      if execution_config is None:
          execution_config = ExecutionConfig()
  ...
  ```

  [(#7697)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7697)

* The `qml.HilbertSchmidt` and `qml.LocalHilbertSchmidt` templates have been updated and their UI has been remarkably simplified. 
  They now accept an operation or a list of operations as quantum unitaries.
  [(#7933)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7933)

  In past versions of PennyLane, these templates required providing the `U` and `V` unitaries as a `qml.tape.QuantumTape` and a quantum function,
  respectively, along with separate parameters and wires.

  With this release, each template has been improved to accept one or more operators as  unitaries. 
  The wires and parameters of the approximate unitary `V` are inferred from the inputs, according to the order provided.

  ```python
  >>> U = qml.Hadamard(0)
  >>> V = qml.RZ(0.1, wires=1)
  >>> qml.HilbertSchmidt(V, U)
  HilbertSchmidt(0.1, wires=[0, 1])
  ```

* Remove support for Python 3.10 and adds support for 3.13.
  [(#7935)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7935)

* Move custom exceptions into `exceptions.py` and add a documentation page for them in the internals.
  [(#7856)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7856)

* The boolean functions provided in `qml.operation` are deprecated. See the
  :doc:`deprecations page </development/deprecations>` for equivalent code to use instead. These
  include `not_tape`, `has_gen`, `has_grad_method`, `has_multipar`, `has_nopar`, `has_unitary_gen`,
  `is_measurement`, `defines_diagonalizing_gates`, and `gen_is_multi_term_hamiltonian`.
  [(#7924)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7924)

* Removed access for `lie_closure`, `structure_constants` and `center` via `qml.pauli`.
  Top level import and usage is advised. The functions now live in the `liealg` module.

  ```python
  import pennylane.liealg
  from pennylane.liealg import lie_closure, structure_constants, center
  ```

  [(#7928)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7928)
  [(#7994)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7994)

* `qml.operation.Observable` and the corresponding `Observable.compare` have been removed, as
  PennyLane now depends on the more general `Operator` interface instead. The
  `Operator.is_hermitian` property can instead be used to check whether or not it is highly likely
  that the operator instance is Hermitian.
  [(#7927)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7927)

* `qml.operation.WiresEnum`, `qml.operation.AllWires`, and `qml.operation.AnyWires` have been removed. Setting `Operator.num_wires = None` (the default)
  should instead indicate that the `Operator` does not need wire validation.
  [(#7911)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7911)

* Removed `QNode.get_gradient_fn` method. Instead, use `qml.workflow.get_best_diff_method` to obtain the differentiation method.
  [(#7907)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7907)

* Top-level access to ``DeviceError``, ``PennyLaneDeprecationWarning``, ``QuantumFunctionError`` and ``ExperimentalWarning`` has been removed. Please import these objects from the new ``pennylane.exceptions`` module.
  [(#7874)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7874)

* `qml.cut_circuit_mc` no longer accepts a `shots` keyword argument. The shots should instead
  be set on the tape itself.
  [(#7882)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7882)

<h3>Deprecations 👋</h3>

* Setting shots on a device through the `shots=` kwarg, e.g. `qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2, shots=1000)`, is deprecated. Please use the `set_shots` transform on the `QNode` instead.

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

  @qml.set_shots(1000)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x):
      qml.RX(x, wires=0)
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
  ```

  [(#7979)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7979)

* Support for using TensorFlow with PennyLane has been deprecated and will be dropped in Pennylane v0.44.
  Future versions of PennyLane are not guaranteed to work with TensorFlow.
  Instead, we recommend using the :doc:`JAX </introduction/interfaces/jax>` or :doc:`PyTorch </introduction/interfaces/torch>` interface for
  machine learning applications to benefit from enhanced support and features. Please consult the following demos for
  more usage information: 
  [Turning quantum nodes into Torch Layers](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qnn_module_torch) and
  [How to optimize a QML model using JAX and Optax](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_How_to_optimize_QML_model_using_JAX_and_Optax).
  [(#7989)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7989)
  [(#8106)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8106)

* `pennylane.devices.DefaultExecutionConfig` is deprecated and will be removed in v0.44.
  Instead, use `qml.devices.ExecutionConfig()` to create a default execution configuration.
  [(#7987)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7987)

* Specifying the ``work_wire_type`` argument in ``qml.ctrl`` and other controlled operators as ``"clean"`` or 
  ``"dirty"`` is deprecated. Use ``"zeroed"`` to indicate that the work wires are initially in the :math:`|0\rangle`
  state, and ``"borrowed"`` to indicate that the work wires can be in any arbitrary state. In both cases, the
  work wires are restored to their original state upon completing the decomposition.
  [(#7993)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7993)

* Providing `num_steps` to :func:`pennylane.evolve`, :func:`pennylane.exp`, :class:`pennylane.ops.Evolution`,
  and :class:`pennylane.ops.Exp` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Instead, use
  :class:`~.TrotterProduct` for approximate methods, providing the `n` parameter to perform the Suzuki-Trotter
  product approximation of a Hamiltonian with the specified number of Trotter steps.

  As a concrete example, consider the following case:

  ```python
  coeffs = [0.5, -0.6]
  ops = [qml.X(0), qml.X(0) @ qml.Y(1)]
  H_flat = qml.dot(coeffs, ops)
  ```

  Instead of computing the Suzuki-Trotter product approximation as:

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.evolve(H_flat, num_steps=2).decomposition()
  [RX(0.5, wires=[0]),
  PauliRot(-0.6, XY, wires=[0, 1]),
  RX(0.5, wires=[0]),
  PauliRot(-0.6, XY, wires=[0, 1])]
  ```

  The same result can be obtained using :class:`~.TrotterProduct` as follows:

  ```pycon
  >>> decomp_ops = qml.adjoint(qml.TrotterProduct(H_flat, time=1.0, n=2)).decomposition()
  >>> [simp_op for op in decomp_ops for simp_op in map(qml.simplify, op.decomposition())]
  [RX(0.5, wires=[0]),
  PauliRot(-0.6, XY, wires=[0, 1]),
  RX(0.5, wires=[0]),
  PauliRot(-0.6, XY, wires=[0, 1])]
  ```
  [(#7954)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7954)
  [(#7977)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7977)

* `MeasurementProcess.expand` is deprecated. The relevant method can be replaced with 
  `qml.tape.QuantumScript(mp.obs.diagonalizing_gates(), [type(mp)(eigvals=mp.obs.eigvals(), wires=mp.obs.wires)])`
  [(#7953)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7953)

* `shots=` in `QNode` calls is deprecated and will be removed in v0.44.
  Instead, please use the `qml.workflow.set_shots` transform to set the number of shots for a QNode.
  [(#7906)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7906)

* ``QuantumScript.shape`` and ``QuantumScript.numeric_type`` are deprecated and will be removed in version v0.44.
  Instead, the corresponding ``.shape`` or ``.numeric_type`` of the ``MeasurementProcess`` class should be used.
  [(#7950)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7950)

* Some unnecessary methods of the `qml.CircuitGraph` class are deprecated and will be removed in version v0.44:
  [(#7904)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7904)

    - `print_contents` in favor of `print(obj)`
    - `observables_in_order` in favor of `observables`
    - `operations_in_order` in favor of `operations`
    - `ancestors_in_order` in favor of `ancestors(obj, sort=True)`
    - `descendants_in_order` in favore of `descendants(obj, sort=True)`

* The `QuantumScript.to_openqasm` method is deprecated and will be removed in version v0.44.
  Instead, the `qml.to_openqasm` function should be used.
  [(#7909)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7909)

* The `level=None` argument in the :func:`pennylane.workflow.get_transform_program`, :func:`pennylane.workflow.construct_batch`, `qml.draw`, `qml.draw_mpl`, and `qml.specs` transforms is deprecated and will be removed in v0.43.
  Please use `level='device'` instead to apply the noise model at the device level.
  [(#7886)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7886)

* `qml.qnn.cost.SquaredErrorLoss` is deprecated and will be removed in version v0.44. Instead, this hybrid workflow can be accomplished
  with a function like `loss = lambda *args: (circuit(*args) - target)**2`.
  [(#7527)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7527)

* Access to `add_noise`, `insert` and noise mitigation transforms from the `pennylane.transforms` module is deprecated.
  Instead, these functions should be imported from the `pennylane.noise` module.
  [(#7854)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7854)

* The `qml.QNode.add_transform` method is deprecated and will be removed in v0.43.
  Instead, please use `QNode.transform_program.push_back(transform_container=transform_container)`.
  [(#7855)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7855)

<h3>Internal changes ⚙️</h3>

* Unpin `autoray` package in `pyproject.toml` by fixing source code that was broken by release.
  [(#8147)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8147)

* The `autograph` keyword argument has been removed from the `QNode` constructor. 
  To enable autograph conversion, use the `qjit` decorator together with the `qml.capture.disable_autograph` context manager.
  [(#8104)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8104)
  
* Add ability to disable autograph conversion using the newly added `qml.capture.disable_autograph` decorator or context manager.
  [(#8102)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8102)

  [(#8080)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8080)

* Removed unnecessary execution tests along with accuracy validation in `tests/ops/functions/test_map_wires.py`.
  [(#8032)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8032)

* Added a new `all-tests-passed` gatekeeper job to `interface-unit-tests.yml` to ensure all test
  jobs complete successfully before triggering downstream actions. This reduces the need to
  maintain a long list of required checks in GitHub settings. Also added the previously missing
  `capture-jax-tests` job to the list of required test jobs, ensuring this test suite is properly
  enforced in CI.
  [(#7996)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7996)

* Equipped `DefaultQubitLegacy` (test suite only) with seeded sampling.
  This allows for reproducible sampling results of legacy classical shadow across CI.
  [(#7903)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7903)

* Capture does not block `wires=0` anymore. This allows Catalyst to work with zero-wire devices.
  Note that `wires=None` is still illegal.

  `qml.compiler.python_compiler` submodule.
  [(#7888)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7888)

* Added a `dialects` submodule to `qml.compiler.python_compiler` which now houses all the xDSL dialects we create.
  Additionally, the `MBQCDialect` and `QuantumDialect` dialects have been renamed to `MBQC` and `Quantum`.
  [(#7897)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7897)

* Update minimum supported `pytest` version to `8.4.1`.
  [(#7853)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7853)

* `LinearCombination` instances can be created with `_primitive.impl` when
  capture is enabled and tracing is active.
  [(#7893)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7893)

* The `TensorLike` type is now compatible with static type checkers.
  [(#7905)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7905)

* Update JAX version used in tests to `0.6.2`
  [(#7925)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7925)

* The measurement-plane attribute of the Python compiler `mbqc` dialect now uses the "opaque syntax"
  format when printing in the generic IR format. This enables usage of this attribute when IR needs
  to be passed from the python compiler to Catalyst.
  [(#7957)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7957)

* An `xdsl_extras` module has been added to the Python compiler to house additional utilities and
  functionality not available upstream in xDSL.
