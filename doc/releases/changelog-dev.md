# Release 0.21.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Added the adjoint method for the metric tensor.
  [(#1992)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1992)

  This method, detailed in [Jones 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02991),
  computes the metric tensor using four copies of the state vector and
  a number of operations that scales quadratically in the number of trainable
  parameters (see below for details).
  
  Note that as it makes use of state cloning, it is inherently classical
  and to be used on state vector simulators and without shots only.

  It is particular useful for larger circuits for which backpropagation requires
  inconvenient or even unfeasible amounts of storage, but is slower.
  Furthermore, the adjoint method is only available for analytic computation, not
  for measurements simulation with `shots!=None`.

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)
  
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(x, y):
      qml.Rot(*x[0], wires=0)
      qml.Rot(*x[1], wires=1)
      qml.Rot(*x[2], wires=2)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
      qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 2])
      qml.CNOT(wires=[2, 0])
      qml.RY(y[0], wires=0)
      qml.RY(y[1], wires=1)
      qml.RY(y[0], wires=2)

  x = np.array([[0.2, 0.4, -0.1], [-2.1, 0.5, -0.2], [0.1, 0.7, -0.6]], requires_grad=False)
  y = np.array([1.3, 0.2], requires_grad=True)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.adjoint_metric_tensor(circuit)(x, y)
  tensor([[ 0.25495723, -0.07086695],
          [-0.07086695,  0.24945606]], requires_grad=True)
  ```

  Computational cost

  The adjoint method uses :math:`2P^2+4P+1` gates and state cloning operations if the circuit
  is composed only of trainable gates, where :math:`P` is the number of trainable operations.
  If non-trainable gates are included, each of them is applied about :math:`n^2-n` times, where
  :math:`n` is the number of trainable operations that follow after the respective 
  non-trainable operation in the circuit. This means that non-trainable gates later in the 
  circuit are executed less often, making the adjoint method a bit cheaper if such gates
  appear later.


<h3>Improvements</h3>

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fixes a bug in `classical_jacobian` when used with Torch, where the
  Jacobian of the preprocessing was also computed for non-trainable
  parameters.
  [(#2020)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2020)

* Fixes a bug in queueing of the `two_qubit_decomposition` method that
  originally led to circuits with >3 two-qubit unitaries failing when passed
  through the `unitary_to_rot` optimization transform.
  [(#2015)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2015)

<h3>Documentation</h3>

* Extended the interfaces description page to explicitly mention device
  compatibility.
  [(#2031)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2031)
