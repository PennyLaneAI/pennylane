# Release 0.22.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Parametric operations now have the `parameter_frequencies`
  method that returns the frequencies with which a parameter
  enters a circuit when using the operation.
  [(#2180)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2180)

  The frequencies can be used for circuit analysis, optimization
  via the `RotosolveOptimizer` and differentiation with the
  parameter-shift rule. They assume that the circuit returns
  expectation values or probabilities, for a variance
  measurement the frequencies will differ.

* Continued development of the circuit-cutting compiler:

  A method for converting a quantum tape to a directed multigraph that is amenable
  to graph partitioning algorithms for circuit cutting has been added.
  [(#2107)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2107)

  A method to replace `WireCut` nodes in a directed multigraph with `MeasureNode`
  and `PrepareNode` placeholders has been added.
  [(#2124)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2124)

  A method has been added that takes a directed multigraph with `MeasureNode` and
  `PrepareNode` placeholders and fragments into subgraphs and a communication graph.
  [(#2153)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2153)

  A differentiable tensor contraction function `contract_tensors` has been
  added.
  [(#2158)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2158)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Added a new `partition_pauli_group` function to the `grouping` module for
  efficiently measuring the `N`-qubit Pauli group with `3 ** N`
  qubit-wise commuting terms.
  [(#2185)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2185)

  ```

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* The `MultiControlledX` operation now accepts a single `wires` keyword argument for both `control_wires` and `wires`.
  The single `wires` keyword should be all the control wires followed by a single target wire. 
  [(#2121)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2121)

<h3>Deprecations</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* The operation `OrbitalRotation` previously was wrongfully registered to satisfy
  the four-term parameter shift rule, it now will be decomposed instead when
  using the parameter-shift rule.
  [(#2180)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2180)

<h3>Documentation</h3>

* The ``pennylane.numpy`` subpackage is now included in the PennyLane
  API documentation.
  [(#2179)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2179)

* Improves the documentation of `RotosolveOptimizer` regarding the
  usage of the passed `substep_optimizer` and its keyword arguments.
  [(#2160)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2160)
