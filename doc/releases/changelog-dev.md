# Release 0.42.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* The transform `convert_to_mbqc_gateset` is added to the `ftqc` module to convert arbitrary 
  circuits to a limited gate-set that can be translated to the MBQC formalism.
  [(7271)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7271)

* The `RotXZX` operation is added to the `ftqc` module to support definition of a universal
  gate-set that can be translated to the MBQC formalism.

  [(#7185)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7185)

* Add new `pennylane.exceptions` module for custom errors and warnings.
  [(#7205)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7205)

* Clean up `__init__.py` files in `math`, `ops`, `qaoa`, `tape` and `templates` to be explicit in what they import. 
  [(#7200)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7200)

<h3>Documentation 📝</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes 🐛</h3>

* Gradient transforms can now be used in conjunction with batch transforms with all interfaces.
  [(#7287)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7287)

* Fixes a bug where the global phase was not being added in the ``QubitUnitary`` decomposition.  
  [(#7244)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7244)
  [(#7270)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7270)

* Using finite differences with program capture without x64 mode enabled now raises a warning.
  [(#7282)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7282)

* When the `mcm_method` is specified to the `"device"`, the `defer_measurements` transform will 
  no longer be applied. Instead, the device will be responsible for all MCM handling.
  [(#7243)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7243)

* Fixed coverage of `qml.liealg.CII` and `qml.liealg.AIII`.
