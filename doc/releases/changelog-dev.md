# Release 0.23.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Development of a circuit-cutting compiler extension to circuits with sampling
  measurements has begun:

  - The existing `qcut.tape_to_graph()` method has been extended to convert a
    sample measurement without an observable specified to multiple single-qubit sample
    nodes.
