# Release 0.44.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Added a :meth:`~pennylane.devices.DeviceCapabilities.gate_set` method to :class:`~pennylane.devices.DeviceCapabilities`
  that produces a set of gate names to be used as the target gate set in decompositions.
  [(#8522)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8522)

<h3>Improvements üõ†</h3>

* The new graph based decompositions system enabled via :func:`~.decomposition.enable_graph` now supports the following
  additional templates.
  [(#8520)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8520)
  [(#8515)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8515)
  [(#8516)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8516)
  
  - :class:`~.QSVT`
  - :class:`~.AmplitudeEmbedding`
  - :class:`~.AllSinglesDoubles`

* Added a keyword argument ``recursive`` to ``qml.transforms.cancel_inverses`` that enables
  recursive cancellation of nested pairs of mutually inverse gates. This makes the transform
  more powerful, because it can cancel larger blocks of inverse gates without having to scan
  the circuit from scratch. By default, the recursive cancellation is enabled (``recursive=True``).
  To obtain previous behaviour, disable it by setting ``recursive=False``.
  [(#8483)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8483)

* `qml.grad` and `qml.jacobian` now lazily dispatch to catalyst and program
  capture, allowing for `qml.qjit(qml.grad(c))` and `qml.qjit(qml.jacobian(c))` to work.
  [(#8382)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8382)

* Both the generic and transform-specific application behavior of a `qml.transforms.core.TransformDispatcher`
  can be overwritten with `TransformDispatcher.generic_register` and `my_transform.register`.
  [(#7797)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7797)

* With capture enabled, measurements can now be performed on Operator instances passed as closure
  variables from outside the workflow scope.
  [(#8504)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8504)

* Users can now estimate the resources for quantum circuits that contain or decompose into
  any of the following symbolic operators: :class:`~.ChangeOpBasis`, :class:`~.Prod`,
  :class:`~.Controlled`, :class:`~.ControlledOp`, :class:`~.Pow`, and :class:`~.Adjoint`.
  [(#8464)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8464)

* Wires can be specified via `range` with program capture and autograph.

<h3>Breaking changes üíî</h3>

* Providing ``num_steps`` to :func:`pennylane.evolve`, :func:`pennylane.exp`, :class:`pennylane.ops.Evolution`,
  and :class:`pennylane.ops.Exp` has been disallowed. Instead, use :class:`~.TrotterProduct` for approximate
  methods, providing the ``n`` parameter to perform the Suzuki-Trotter product approximation of a Hamiltonian
  with the specified number of Trotter steps.
  [(#8474)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8474)

  As a concrete example, consider the following case:

  .. code-block:: python

    coeffs = [0.5, -0.6]
    ops = [qml.X(0), qml.X(0) @ qml.Y(1)]
    H_flat = qml.dot(coeffs, ops)

  Instead of computing the Suzuki-Trotter product approximation as:

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.evolve(H_flat, num_steps=2).decomposition()
  [RX(0.5, wires=[0]),
  PauliRot(-0.6, XY, wires=[0, 1]),
  RX(0.5, wires=[0]),
  PauliRot(-0.6, XY, wires=[0, 1])]
  ```

  The same result can be obtained using :class:`~.TrotterProduct` as follows:

  ```pycon
  >>> decomp_ops = qml.adjoint(qml.TrotterProduct(H_flat, time=1.0, n=2)).decomposition()
  >>> [simp_op for op in decomp_ops for simp_op in map(qml.simplify, op.decomposition())]
  [RX(0.5, wires=[0]),
  PauliRot(-0.6, XY, wires=[0, 1]),
  RX(0.5, wires=[0]),
  PauliRot(-0.6, XY, wires=[0, 1])]
  ```

* The value ``None`` has been removed as a valid argument to the ``level`` parameter in the
  :func:`pennylane.workflow.get_transform_program`, :func:`pennylane.workflow.construct_batch`,
  :func:`pennylane.draw`, :func:`pennylane.draw_mpl`, and :func:`pennylane.specs` transforms.
  Please use ``level='device'`` instead to apply the transform at the device level.
  [(#8477)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8477)

* Access to ``add_noise``, ``insert`` and noise mitigation transforms from the ``pennylane.transforms`` module is deprecated.
  Instead, these functions should be imported from the ``pennylane.noise`` module.
  [(#8477)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8477)

* ``qml.qnn.cost.SquaredErrorLoss`` has been removed. Instead, this hybrid workflow can be accomplished
  with a function like ``loss = lambda *args: (circuit(*args) - target)**2``.
  [(#8477)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8477)

* Some unnecessary methods of the ``qml.CircuitGraph`` class have been removed:
  [(#8477)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8477)

  - ``print_contents`` in favor of ``print(obj)``
  - ``observables_in_order`` in favor of ``observables``
  - ``operations_in_order`` in favor of ``operations``
  - ``ancestors_in_order(obj)`` in favor of ``ancestors(obj, sort=True)``
  - ``descendants_in_order(obj)`` in favor of ``descendants(obj, sort=True)``

* ``pennylane.devices.DefaultExecutionConfig`` has been removed. Instead, use
  ``qml.devices.ExecutionConfig()`` to create a default execution configuration.
  [(#8470)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8470)

* Specifying the ``work_wire_type`` argument in ``qml.ctrl`` and other controlled operators as ``"clean"`` or
  ``"dirty"`` is disallowed. Use ``"zeroed"`` to indicate that the work wires are initially in the :math:`|0\rangle`
  state, and ``"borrowed"`` to indicate that the work wires can be in any arbitrary state. In both cases, the
  work wires are assumed to be restored to their original state upon completing the decomposition.
  [(#8470)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8470)

* `QuantumScript.shape` and `QuantumScript.numeric_type` are removed. The corresponding `MeasurementProcess`
  methods should be used instead.
  [(#8468)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8468)

* `MeasurementProcess.expand` is removed.
  `qml.tape.QuantumScript(mp.obs.diagonalizing_gates(), [type(mp)(eigvals=mp.obs.eigvals(), wires=mp.obs.wires)])`
  can be used instead.
  [(#8468)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8468)

* The `qml.QNode.add_transform` method is removed.
  Instead, please use `QNode.transform_program.push_back(transform_container=transform_container)`.
  [(#8468)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8468)

<h3>Deprecations üëã</h3>

* Access to the follow functions and classes from the ``pennylane.resources`` module are deprecated. Instead, these functions must be imported from the ``pennylane.estimator`` module.
  [(#8484)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8484)
    
    - ``qml.estimator.estimate_shots`` in favor of ``qml.resources.estimate_shots``
    - ``qml.estimator.estimate_error`` in favor of ``qml.resources.estimate_error``
    - ``qml.estimator.FirstQuantization`` in favor of ``qml.resources.FirstQuantization``
    - ``qml.estimator.DoubleFactorization`` in favor of ``qml.resources.DoubleFactorization``

* ``argnum`` has been renamed ``argnums`` for ``qml.grad``, ``qml.jacobian``, ``qml.jvp`` and `qml.vjp``.
  [(#8496)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8496)
  [(#8481)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8481)

* The :func:`pennylane.devices.preprocess.mid_circuit_measurements` transform is deprecated. Instead,
  the device should determine which mcm method to use, and explicitly include :func:`~pennylane.transforms.dynamic_one_shot`
  or :func:`~pennylane.transforms.defer_measurements` in its preprocess transforms if necessary.
  [(#8467)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8467)

<h3>Internal changes ‚öôÔ∏è</h3>

* Reclassifies `registers` as a tertiary module for use with tach.
  [(#8513)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8513)

* The experimental xDSL implementation of `diagonalize_measurements` has been updated to fix a bug
  that included the wrong SSA value for final qubit insertion and deallocation at the end of the
  circuit. A clear error is now also raised when there are observables with overlapping wires.
  [(#8383)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8383)

* The experimental xDSL implementation of `measurements_from_samples_pass` has been updated to support `shots` defined by an `arith.constant` operation.
  [(#8460)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8460)

* The :class:`~pennylane.devices.LegacyDeviceFacade` is slightly refactored to implement `setup_execution_config` and `preprocess_transforms`
  separately as opposed to implementing a single `preprocess` method. Additionally, the `mid_circuit_measurements` transform has been removed
  from the preprocess transform program. Instead, the best mcm method is chosen in `setup_execution_config`. By default, the ``_capabilities``
  dictionary is queried for the ``"supports_mid_measure"`` property. If the underlying device defines a TOML file, the ``supported_mcm_methods``
  field in the TOML file is used as the source of truth.
  [(#8469)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8469)
  [(#8486)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8486)
  [(#8495)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8495)

* The various private functions of the :class:`~pennylane.estimator.FirstQuantization` class have 
  been modified to avoid using `numpy.matrix` as this function is deprecated.
  [(#8523)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8523)

* The `ftqc` module now includes dummy transforms for several Catalyst/MLIR passes (`to-ppr`, `commute-ppr`, `merge-ppr-ppm`, `pprm-to-mbqc` 
  and `reduce-t-depth`), to allow them to be captured as primitives in PLxPR and mapped to the MLIR passes in Catalyst. This enables using the passes with the unified compiler and program capture.
  [(#8519)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8519)

* The decompositions for several templates have been updated to use 
  :class:`~.ops.op_math.ChangeOpBasis`, which makes their decompositions more resource efficient
  by eliminating unnecessary controlled operations. The templates include :class:`~.PhaseAdder`, 
  :class:`~.TemporaryAND`, :class:`~.QSVT`, and :class:`~.SelectPauliRot`.
  [(#8490)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8490)


<h3>Documentation üìù</h3>

<h3>Bug fixes üêõ</h3>

* Fixes a bug in ``QubitUnitaryOp.__init__`` in the unified compiler module that prevented an
  instance from being constructed.
  [(#8456)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/8456)

* Fixes a bug where the deferred measurement method is used silently even if ``mcm_method="one-shot"`` is explicitly requested,
  when a device that extends the ``LegacyDevice`` does not declare support for mid-circuit measurements.
