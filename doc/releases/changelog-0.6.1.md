# Release 0.6.1

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Added a `print_applied` method to QNodes, allowing the operation
  and observable queue to be printed as last constructed.
  [(#378)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/378)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* A new `Operator` base class is introduced, which is inherited by both the
  `Observable` class and the `Operation` class.
  [(#355)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/355)

* Removed deprecated `@abstractproperty` decorators
  in `_device.py`.
  [(#374)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/374)

* The `CircuitGraph` class is updated to deal with `Operation` instances directly.
  [(#344)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/344)

* Comprehensive gradient tests have been added for the interfaces.
  [(#381)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/381)

  parameters. AmplitudeEmbedding tests have been added and improved.
