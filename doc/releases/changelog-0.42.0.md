# Release 0.42.0 (current release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h4>State-of-the-art templates and decompositions üêù</h4>

* A new decomposition using [unary iteration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03662) has been added to :class:`~.Select`.
  This state-of-the-art decomposition reduces the :class:`~.T`-count significantly, and uses :math:`c-1` auxiliary wires,
  where :math:`c` is the number of control wires of the `Select` operator.
  [(#7623)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7623)
  [(#7744)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7744)
  [(#7842)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7842)

* A new template called :class:`~.TemporaryAND` has been added. :class:`~.TemporaryAND` enables more 
  efficient circuit decompositions, such as the newest decomposition of the :class:`~.Select` template.
  [(#7472)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7472)

* A new template called :class:`~.SemiAdder` has been added, which provides state-of-the-art 
  resource-efficiency (fewer :class:`~.T` gates) when performing addition on a quantum computer.
  [(#7494)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7494)

* A new template called :class:`~.SelectPauliRot` is available, which applies a sequence of 
  uniformly controlled rotations on a target qubit. This operator appears frequently in unitary 
  decompositions and block-encoding techniques. 
  [(#7206)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7206)
  [(#7617)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7617)

* The decompositions of :class:`~.SingleExcitation`, :class:`~.SingleExcitationMinus` and 
  :class:`~.SingleExcitationPlus` have been made more efficient by reducing the number of rotations 
  gates and ``CNOT``, ``CZ``, and ``CY`` gates (where applicable). This leads to lower circuit depth 
  when decomposing these gates.
  [(#7771)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7771)

<h4>QSVT & QSP angle solver for large polynomials üï∏Ô∏è</h4>

* A new iterative angle solver for QSVT and QSP is available in the 
  :func:`poly_to_angles <pennylane.poly_to_angles>` function, designed for angle computation for 
  polynomials with degrees larger than 1000.
  [(6694)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6694)

<h4>Qualtran integration üîó</h4>

* It's now possible to convert PennyLane circuits and operators to 
  [Qualtran](https://qualtran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) circuits and Bloqs with the new 
  :func:`qml.to_bloq <pennylane.to_bloq>` function. This function translates PennyLane circuits (qfuncs or 
  QNodes) and operations into equivalent
  [Qualtran bloqs](https://qualtran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bloqs/index.html#bloqs-library), 
  enabling a new way to estimate 
  the resource requirements of PennyLane quantum circuits via Qualtran's abstractions and tools.

<h4>Resource-efficient Clifford-T decompositions üçÉ</h4>

* The [Ross-Selinger algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2975),
  also known as Gridsynth, can now be accessed in :func:`~.clifford_t_decomposition` by setting
  `method="gridsynth"`. This is a newer Clifford-T decomposition method that can produce orders of 
  magnitude fewer gates than using `method="sk"` (Solovay-Kitaev algorithm).

<h4>OpenQASM ü§ù PennyLane</h4>

* Use the new :func:`qml.from_qasm3 <pennylane.from_qasm3>` function to convert your OpenQASM 3.0 
  circuits into quantum functions which can then be loaded into QNodes and executed.

<h3>Improvements üõ†</h3>

<h4>A quantum optimizer that works with QJIT</h4>

* Leveraging quantum just-in-time compilation to optimize parameterized hybrid workflows with the quantum 
  natural gradient optimizer is now possible with the new :class:`~.QNGOptimizerQJIT` optimizer. 
  [(#7452)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7452)

<h4>Resource-efficient decompositions üîé</h4>

* With graph-based decomposition enabled via :func:`~.decomposition.enable_graph`, the 
  :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform now supports weighting gates in the target `gate_set`, 
  allowing for preferential treatment of certain gates in a target `gate_set` over others.
  [(#7389)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7389)

* Decomposition rules that can be accessed with the new graph-based decomposition system have been
  implemented for the following operators:

  * :class:`~.QubitUnitary`
    [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

  * :class:`~.ControlledQubitUnitary`
    [(#7371)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7371)

  * :class:`~.DiagonalQubitUnitary`
    [(#7625)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7625)

  * :class:`~.MultiControlledX`
    [(#7405)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7405)

  * :class:`~.ops.Exp` 
    [(#7489)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7489)
    Specifically, the following decompositions have been added:
    
    - Suzuki-Trotter decomposition when the `num_steps` keyword argument is specified.
    - Decomposition to a :class:`~.PauliRot` when the base is a single-term Pauli word.

  * :class:`~.PCPhase`
    [(#7591)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7591)

  * :class:`~.QuantumPhaseEstimation`
    [(#7637)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7637)

  * :class:`~.BasisRotation`
    [(#7074)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7074)

  * :class:`~.PhaseAdder`
    [(#7070)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7070)

  * :class:`~.IntegerComparator`
    [(#7636)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7636)

* With graph-based decomposition enabled with :func:`~.decomposition.enable_graph`, a new 
  decomposition rule that uses a single work wire for decomposing multi-controlled operators can be
  accessed.
  [(#7383)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7383)

* With graph-based decomposition enabled with :func:`~.decomposition.enable_graph`, a new decorator 
  called :func:`~.decomposition.register_condition` can be used to bind a condition to a 
  decomposition rule denoting when it is applicable.
  [(#7439)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7439)

* Symbolic operator types (e.g., `Adjoint`, `Controlled`, and `Pow`) can now be specified as strings
  in various parts of the new graph-based decomposition system:

  * The `gate_set` argument of the :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform now supports adding 
    symbolic operators in the target gate set.
    [(#7331)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7331)

  * Symbolic operator types can now be given as strings to the `op_type` argument of 
    :func:`~.decomposition.add_decomps`, or as keys of the dictionaries passed to the `alt_decomps` 
    and `fixed_decomps` arguments of the :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform, allowing custom 
    decomposition rules to be defined and registered for symbolic operators.
    [(#7347)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7347)
    [(#7352)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7352)
    [(#7362)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7362)
    [(#7499)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7499)

* A `work_wire_type` argument has been added to :func:`~pennylane.ctrl` and 
  :class:`~pennylane.ControlledQubitUnitary` for more fine-grained control over the type of work 
  wire used in their decompositions.
  [(#7612)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7612)

* The :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform now accepts a `stopping_condition` argument with 
  graph-based decomposition enabled, which must be a function that returns `True` if an operator 
  does not need to be decomposed (it meets the requirements as described in `stopping_condition`).
  See the documentation for more details.
  [(#7531)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7531)

* Two-qubit `QubitUnitary` gates no longer decompose into fundamental rotation gates; it now 
  decomposes into single-qubit `QubitUnitary` gates. This allows the graph-based decomposition 
  system to further decompose single-qubit unitary gates more flexibly using different rotations.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

* A new decomposition for two-qubit unitaries has been implemented in :func:`~.ops.two_qubit_decomposition`.
  It ensures the correctness of the decomposition in some edge cases but uses 3 CNOT gates even if 2 CNOTs
  would suffice theoretically.
  [(#7474)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7474)

* The `gate_set` argument of :func:`~.transforms.decompose` now accepts `"X"`, `"Y"`, `"Z"`, `"H"`, 
  `"I"` as aliases for `"PauliX"`, `"PauliY"`, `"PauliZ"`, `"Hadamard"`, and `"Identity"`. These 
  aliases are also recognized as part of symbolic operators. For example, `"Adjoint(H)"` is now 
  accepted as an alias for `"Adjoint(Hadamard)"`.
  [(#7331)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7331)

<h4>Setting shots üîÅ</h4>

* A new QNode transform called :func:`~.transforms.set_shots` has been added to set or update the 
  number of shots to be performed, overriding shots specified in the device.
  [(#7337)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7337)
  [(#7358)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7358)

  [(#7500)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7500)
  [(#7627)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7627)

<h4>QChem</h4>

* The `qchem` module has been upgraded with new functions to construct a vibrational Hamiltonian in 
  the Christiansen representation. 
  [(#7491)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7491)
  [(#7596)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7596)
  [(#7785)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7785)

<h4>Experimental FTQC module</h4>

* Commutation rules for a Clifford gate set (`qml.H`, `qml.S`, `qml.CNOT`) have been added to the 
  `ftqc.pauli_tracker` module, accessible via the `commute_clifford_op` function.
  [(#7444)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7444)

* Offline byproduct correction support has been added to the `ftqc` module.
  [(#7447)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7447)

* The `ftqc` module `measure_arbitrary_basis`, `measure_x` and `measure_y` functions can now be 
  captured when program capture is enabled.
  [(#7219)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7219)
  [(#7368)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7368)

* Functions called `pauli_to_xz`, `xz_to_pauli` and `pauli_prod` that are related to `xz`-encoding 
  have been added to the `ftqc` module.
  [(#7433)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7433)

* A new transform called `convert_to_mbqc_formalism` has been added to the `ftqc` module to convert 
  a circuit already expressed in a limited, compatible gate set into the MBQC formalism. Circuits 
  can be converted to the relevant gate set with the `convert_to_mbqc_gateset` transform.
  [(#7355)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7355)
  [(#7586)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7586)

* The `RotXZX` operation has been added to the `ftqc` module to support the definition of a 
  universal gate set that can be translated to the MBQC formalism.
  [(#7271)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7271)

<h4>Other improvements</h4>

* `qml.evolve` now errors out if the first argument is not a valid type.
  [(#7768)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7768)

* `qml.PauliError` now accepts Pauli strings that include the identity operator.
  [(#7760)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7760)

* Caching with finite shots now always warns about the lack of expected noise.
  [(#7644)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7644)

* `cache` now defaults to `"auto"` with `qml.execute`, matching the behavior of `QNode` and 
  increasing the performance of using `qml.execute` for standard executions.
  [(#7644)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7644)

* `qml.grad` and `qml.jacobian` can now handle inputs with dynamic shapes being captured into plxpr.
  [(#7544)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7544/)

* The drawing of `GlobalPhase`, `ctrl(GlobalPhase)`, `Identity` and `ctrl(Identity)` operations has 
  been improved. The labels are grouped together as in other multi-qubit operations, and the drawing 
  no longer depends on the wires of `GlobalPhase` or `Identity`. Control nodes of controlled global 
  phases and identities no longer receive the operator label, which is in line with other controlled 
  operations.
  [(#7457)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7457)

* The decomposition of :class:`~.PCPhase` is now significantly more efficient for more than 2 qubits.
  [(#7166)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7166)

* The decomposition of :class:`~.IntegerComparator` is now significantly more efficient.
  [(#7636)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7636)

* :class:`~.QubitUnitary` now supports a decomposition that is compatible with an arbitrary number 
  of qubits. This represents a fundamental improvement over the previous implementation, which was
  limited to two-qubit systems.
  [(#7277)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7277)

* Setting up the configuration of a workflow, including the determination of the best diff method, 
  is now done *after* user transforms have been applied. This allows transforms to update the shots 
  and change measurement processes with fewer issues.
  [(#7358)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7358)
  [(#7461)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7461)

* The decomposition of `DiagonalQubitUnitary` has been updated from a recursive decomposition into a 
  smaller `DiagonalQubitUnitary` and a `SelectPauliRot` operation. This is a known decomposition 
  from [Theorem 7 in Shende et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406176) that contains fewer 
  gates.
  [(#7370)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7370)
 
* An experimental integration for a Python compiler using [xDSL](https://xdsl.dev/index) has been introduced.
  This is similar to 
  [Catalyst's MLIR dialects](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/stable/dev/dialects.html#mlir-dialects-in-catalyst), 
  but it is coded in Python instead of C++. Compiler passes written using xDSL can be registered as 
  compatible passes via the `@compiler_transform` decorator.

  [(#7706)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7706)

* An xDSL pass called `qml.compiler.python_compiler.transforms.MergeRotationsPass` has been added 
  for applying `merge_rotations` to an xDSL module for the experimental xDSL Python compiler 
  integration.
  [(#7364)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7364)
  [(#7595)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7595)
  [(#7664)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7664)

* An xDSL pass called `qml.compiler.python_compiler.transforms.IterativeCancelInversesPass` has been 
  added for applying `cancel_inverses` iteratively to an xDSL module for the experimental xDSL 
  Python compiler integration. This pass is optimized to cancel self-inverse operations iteratively.
  [(#7363)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7363)
  [(#7595)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7595)

* PennyLane now supports `jax == 0.6.0` and `0.5.3`.
  [(#6919)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6919)
  [(#7299)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7299)

* The alias for `Identity` (`I`) is now accessible from `qml.ops`.
  [(#7200)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7200)
  
* A new `allocation` module containing `allocate` and `deallocate` instructions has been added for 
  requesting dynamic wires. This is currently experimental and not integrated into any execution 
  pipelines.
  [(#7704)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7704)
  [(#7710)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7710)

* Computing the angles for uniformly controlled rotations, used in 
  :class:`~.MottonenStatePreparation` and :class:`~.SelectPauliRot` now takes much less 
  computational effort and memory.
  [(#7377)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7377)

* Classical shadows with mixed quantum states are now computed with a dedicated method that uses an
  iterative algorithm similar to the handling of shadows with state vectors. This makes shadows with 
  density matrices much more performant.
  [(#7458)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7458)

* Two new functions called :func:`~.math.convert_to_su2` and :func:`~.math.convert_to_su4` have been 
  added to `qml.math`, which convert unitary matrices to SU(2) or SU(4), respectively, and 
  optionally a global phase.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

* `Operator.num_wires` now defaults to `None` to indicate that the operator can be on any number of 
  wires.
  [(#7312)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7312)

* Shots can now be overridden for specific `qml.Snapshot` instances via a `shots` keyword argument.
  [(#7326)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7326)

* PennyLane no longer validates that an operation has at least one wire, as having this check 
  reduced performance by requiring the abstract interface to maintain a list of special 
  implementations.
  [(#7327)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7327)

* Two new device-developer transforms have been added to `devices.preprocess`: 
  :func:`~.devices.preprocess.measurements_from_counts` and 
  :func:`~.devices.preprocess.measurements_from_samples`.
  These transforms modify the tape to instead contain a `counts` or `sample` measurement process, 
  deriving the original measurements from the raw counts/samples in post-processing. This allows 
  expanded measurement support for devices that only support counts/samples at execution, like real 
  hardware devices.
  [(#7317)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7317)

* The Sphinx version was updated to 8.1. 
  [(7212)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7212)

* The `setup.py` package build and install has been migrated to `pyproject.toml`.
  [(#7375)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7375)

* GitHub actions and workflows (`rtd.yml`, `readthedocs.yml`, and `docs.yml`) have been updated to 
  use `ubuntu-24.04` runners.
  [(#7396)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7396)

* The requirements and pyproject files have been updated to include other packages.  
  [(#7417)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7417)

* Documentation checks have been updated to remove duplicate docstring references. 
  [(#7453)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7453)

* The performance of `qml.clifford_t_decomposition` has been improved by introducing caching support 
  and changing the default basis set of `qml.ops.sk_decomposition` to `(H, S, T)`, resulting in 
  shorter decomposition sequences.
  [(#7454)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7454)

* The decomposition of `qml.BasisState` with capture and the graph-based decomposition systems 
  enabled is more efficient.
  [(#7722)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7722)

<h3>Labs: a place for unified and rapid prototyping of research software üß™</h3>

* The imports of dependencies introduced by ``labs`` functionalities have been modified such that
  these dependencies only have to be installed for the functions that use them, not to use
  ``labs`` functionalities in general. This decouples the various submodules, and even functions
  within the same submodule, from each other.
  [(#7650)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7650)

* A new module called :mod:`qml.labs.intermediate_reps <pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps>` has been 
  added to provide functionality to compute intermediate representations for particular circuits.
  The :func:`parity_matrix <pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps.parity_matrix>` function computes
  the parity matrix intermediate representation for `CNOT` circuits, and the
  :func:`phase_polynomial <pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps.phase_polynomial>` function computes
  the phase polynomial intermediate representation for `{CNOT, RZ}` circuits. These efficient 
  intermediate representations are important for CNOT routing algorithms and other quantum 
  compilation routines.

  [(#7333)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7333)
  [(#7629)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7629)
  
* The `pennylane.labs.vibrational` module has been upgraded to use features from the `concurrency` 
  module to perform multiprocess and multithreaded execution. 
  [(#7401)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7401)

* A `rowcol` function is now available in `qml.labs.intermediate_reps`. Given the parity matrix of a 
  `CNOT` circuit and a qubit connectivity graph, it synthesizes a possible implementation of the 
  parity matrix that respects the connectivity.
  [(#7394)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7394)

* `qml.labs.QubitManager`, `qml.labs.AllocWires`, and `qml.labs.FreeWires` classes have been added 
  to track and manage auxiliary qubits.
  [(#7404)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7404)

* A new function called `qml.labs.map_to_resource_op` has been added to map PennyLane Operations to 
  their resource equivalents.
  [(#7434)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7434)

* A new class called `qml.labs.Resources` has been added to store and track the quantum resources 
  from a circuit.
  [(#7406)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7406)
  
* A new class called `qml.labs.CompressedResourceOp` class has been added to store information about 
  the operator type and parameters for the purposes of resource estimation.
  [(#7408)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7408)

* A base class called `qml.labs.ResourceOperator` has been added which will be used to implement all 
  quantum operators for resource estimation.

  [(#7549)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7549)

* A new function called `qml.labs.estimate_resources` has been added which will be used to perform 
  resource estimation on circuits, `qml.labs.ResourceOperator`, and `qml.labs.Resources` objects.
  [(#7407)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7407)

* A new class called `qml.labs.resource_estimation.CompactHamiltonian` has been added to unblock the 
  need to pass a full Hamiltonian for the purposes of resource estimation. In addition, similar 
  templates called `qml.labs.resource_estimation.ResourceTrotterCDF` and 
  `qml.labs.resource_estimation.ResourceTrotterTHC`
  have been added, which will be used to perform resource estimation for trotterization of CDF and 
  THC Hamiltonians, respectively.
  [(#7705)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7705)

* A new template called `qml.labs.ResourceQubitize` has been added which can be used to perform

  [(#7720)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7720)

* Several new templates for various algorithms required for supporting compact Hamiltonian 
  development and resource estimation have been added: `qml.ResourceOutOfPlaceSquare`, 
  `qml.ResourcePhaseGradient`, `qml.ResourceOutMultiplier`, `qml.ResourceSemiAdder`, `qml.ResourceBasisRotation`, `qml.ResourceSelect`, and 
  `qml.ResourceQROM`.
  [(#7725)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7725)

* A new module called :mod:`qml.labs.zxopt <pennylane.labs.zxopt>` has been added to provide access

  [(#7471)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7471)
  
    * :func:`basic_optimization <pennylane.labs.zxopt.basic_optimization>` performs peephole 
      optimizations on the circuit and is a useful subroutine for other optimization passes.
    * :func:`full_optimize <pennylane.labs.zxopt.full_optimize>` optimizes 
      [(Clifford + T)](https://pennylane.ai/compilation/clifford-t-gate-set) circuits.
    * :func:`full_reduce <pennylane.labs.zxopt.full_reduce>` can optimize arbitrary PennyLane 
      circuits and follows the pipeline described in the 
      [pyzx docs](https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simplify.html).

  [(#7628)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7628)

<h3>Breaking changes üíî</h3>

* Support for gradient keyword arguments as QNode keyword arguments has been removed. Instead please 
  use the new `gradient_kwargs` keyword argument accordingly.
  [(#7648)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7648)

* The default value of `cache` is now `"auto"` with `qml.execute`. Like `QNode`, `"auto"` only turns 
  on caching when `max_diff > 1`.
  [(#7644)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7644)

* The `return_type` property of `MeasurementProcess` has been removed. Please use `isinstance` for 
  type checking instead.
  [(#7322)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7322)

* The `KerasLayer` class in `qml.qnn.keras` has been removed because Keras 2 is no longer actively 
  maintained. Please consider using a different machine learning framework, like 
  `PyTorch <demos/tutorial_qnn_module_torch>`__ or 
  `JAX <demos/tutorial_How_to_optimize_QML_model_using_JAX_and_Optax>`__.
  [(#7320)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7320)

* The `qml.gradients.hamiltonian_grad` function has been removed because this gradient recipe is no
  longer required with the :doc:`new operator arithmetic system </news/new_opmath>`.
  [(#7302)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7302)

* Accessing terms of a tensor product (e.g., `op = X(0) @ X(1)`) via `op.obs` has been removed.
  [(#7324)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7324)

* The `mcm_method` keyword argument in `qml.execute` has been removed.
  [(#7301)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7301)

  Furthermore, the `ControlledQubitUnitary` no longer accepts `QubitUnitary` objects as arguments as its `base`.
  [(#7305)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7305)

* `qml.tape.TapeError` has been removed.
  [(#7205)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7205)

<h3>Deprecations üëã</h3>

Here's a list of deprecations made this release. For a more detailed breakdown of deprecations and alternative code to use instead,
please consult the :doc:`deprecations and removals page </development/deprecations>`.

* Python 3.10 support is deprecated and support will be removed in v0.43. Please upgrade to Python 
  3.11 or newer.

* Support for Mac x86 has been removed. This includes Macs running on Intel processors.
  This is because 
  [JAX has also dropped support for it since 0.5.0](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#jax-050-jan-17-2025),
  with the rationale being that such machines are becoming increasingly scarce. If support for Mac x86 
  platforms is still desired, please install Catalyst v0.11.0, PennyLane v0.41.0, PennyLane-Lightning 
  v0.41.0, and JAX v0.4.28.
  
* Top-level access to `DeviceError`, `PennyLaneDeprecationWarning`, `QuantumFunctionError` and `ExperimentalWarning` have been deprecated and will be removed in v0.43. Please import them from the new `exceptions` module.
  [(#7292)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7292)
  [(#7477)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7477)
  [(#7508)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7508)
  [(#7603)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7603)

* `qml.operation.Observable` and the corresponding `Observable.compare` have been deprecated, as
  PennyLane now depends on the more general `Operator` interface instead. The
  `Operator.is_hermitian` property can instead be used to check whether or not it is highly likely
  that the operator instance is Hermitian.
  [(#7316)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7316)

* The boolean functions provided in `qml.operation` are deprecated. See the 
  :doc:`deprecations page </development/deprecations>` for equivalent code to use instead. These 
  include `not_tape`, `has_gen`, `has_grad_method`, `has_multipar`, `has_nopar`, `has_unitary_gen`, 
  `is_measurement`, `defines_diagonalizing_gates`, and `gen_is_multi_term_hamiltonian`.
  [(#7319)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7319)

* `qml.operation.WiresEnum`, `qml.operation.AllWires`, and `qml.operation.AnyWires` are deprecated. 
  To indicate that an operator can act on any number of wires, `Operator.num_wires = None` should be 
  used instead. This is the default and does not need to be overwritten unless the operator 
  developer wants to add wire number validation.
  [(#7313)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7313)

* The :func:`qml.QNode.get_gradient_fn` method is now deprecated. Instead, use 
  :func:`~.workflow.get_best_diff_method` to obtain the differentiation method.
  [(#7323)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7323)

* With program capture enabled, MCM method validation now happens on execution rather than setup.
  [(#7475)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7475)

* A `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file has been added to the PennyLane repository. This file will allow 
  specifying commits that should be ignored in the output of `git blame`. For example, this can be 
  useful when a single commit includes bulk reformatting.
  [(#7507)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7507)

* A `.gitattributes` file has been added to standardize LF as the end-of-line character for the 
  PennyLane repository.
  [(#7502)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7502)

* `DefaultQubit` now implements `preprocess_transforms` and `setup_execution_config` instead of 
  `preprocess`.
  [(#7468)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7468)

* A subset of `pylint` errors have been fixed in the `tests` folder.
  [(#7446)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7446)

* Excessively expensive test cases that do not add value in `tests/templates/test_subroutines/` have 
  been reduced or removed.

  guidelines more closely.
  [(#7382)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7382)

* `null.qubit` can now support an optional `track_resources` argument which allows it to record which gates are executed.
  [(#7226)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7226)
  [(#7372)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7372)
  [(#7392)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7392)
  [(#7813)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7813)

* A new internal module, `qml.concurrency`, is added to support internal use of multiprocess and multithreaded execution of workloads. This also migrates the use of `concurrent.futures` in `default.qubit` to this new design.
  [(#7303)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7303)

* Test suites in `tests/transforms/test_defer_measurement.py` now use analytic mocker devices to 
  test numeric results.
  [(#7329)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7329)

* A new `pennylane.exceptions` module has been added for custom errors and warnings.
  [(#7205)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7205)
  [(#7292)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7292)

* Several `__init__.py` files in `math`, `ops`, `qaoa`, `tape` and `templates` have been cleaned up 
  to be explicit in what they import. 
  [(#7200)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7200)
  
* The `Tracker` class has been moved into the `devices` module.
  [(#7281)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7281)

* Functions that calculate rotation angles for unitary decompositions have been moved into an 
  internal module called `qml.math.decomposition`.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

<h3>Documentation üìù</h3>

* The documentation for mid-circuit measurements using the Tree Traversal algorithm has been updated
  to reflect supported devices and usage in analytic simulations (see the 
  :doc:`/introduction/dynamic_quantum_circuits` page).

* The functions in `qml.qchem.vibrational` have been updated to include additional information about 
  the theory and input arguments.
  [(#6918)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6918)

* The usage examples for `qml.decomposition.DecompositionGraph` have been updated.
  [(#7692)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7692)

* The entry in the :doc:`/news/program_capture_sharp_bits` has been updated to include additional 
  supported lightning devices (`lightning.kokkos` and `lightning.gpu`).
  [(#7674)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7674)

* The circuit drawings for `qml.Select` and `qml.SelectPauliRot` have been updated to include two 
  commonly used symbols for Select-applying, or -multiplexing, an operator. 
  [(#7464)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7464)
  
* The entry in the :doc:`/news/program_capture_sharp_bits` page for transforms has been updated; 
  non-native transforms being applied to QNodes wherein operators have dynamic wires can lead to 
  incorrect results.
  [(#7426)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7426)

* Fixed the wrong `theta` to `phi` in :class:`~pennylane.IsingXY`.
  [(#7427)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7427)

* In the :doc:`/introduction/compiling_circuits` page, in the "Decomposition in stages" section,
  circuit drawings now render in a way that's easier to read.
  [(#7419)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7419)

* The entry in the :doc:`/news/program_capture_sharp_bits` page for using program capture with 
  Catalyst has been updated. Instead of using ``qjit(experimental_capture=True)``, Catalyst is now 
  compatible with the global toggles ``qml.capture.enable()`` and ``qml.capture.disable()`` for 
  enabling and disabling program capture.
  [(#7298)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7298)

* The simulation technique table in the :doc:`/introduction/dynamic_quantum_circuits` page has been 
  updated to correct an error regarding analytic mode support for the ``tree-traversal`` method; 
  ``tree-traversal`` supports analytic mode.
  [(#7490)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7490)

* A warning has been added to the documentation for `qml.snapshots` and `qml.Snapshot`, clarifying 
  that compilation transforms may move operations across a `Snapshot`.
  [(#7746)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7746)

* In the :doc:`/development/guide/documentation` page, references to the outdated Sphinx and 
  unsupported Python versions have been updated. This helps ensure contributors follow current 
  standards and avoid compatibility issues.
  [(#7479)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7479)

* The documentation of `qml.pulse.drive` has been updated and corrected.
  [(#7459)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7459)

* The API list in the documentation has been alphabetized to ensure consistent ordering. 
  [(#7792)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7792)

<h3>Bug fixes üêõ</h3>

* Fixes `SelectPauliRot._flatten` and `TemporaryAND._primitve_bind_call`.
  [(#7843)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7843)

* Fixes a bug where normalization in `qml.StatePrep` with `normalize=True` was skipped if
  `validate_norm` is set to `False`.
  [(#7835)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7835) 

* The :func:`~.transforms.cancel_inverses` transform no longer changes the order of operations that 
  don't have shared wires, providing a deterministic output.
  [(#7328)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7328)

* Fixed broken support of `qml.matrix` for a `QNode` when using mixed Torch GPU & CPU data for 
  parametric tensors.
  [(#7775)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7775) 

* Fixed `CircuitGraph.iterate_parametrized_layers`, and thus `metric_tensor`, when the same 
  operation occurs multiple times in the circuit.
  [(#7757)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7757)

* Fixed a bug with transforms that require the classical Jacobian applied to QNodes, where only
  some arguments are trainable and an intermediate transform does not preserve trainability 
  information.
  [(#7345)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7345)

* The `qml.ftqc.ParametricMidMeasureMP` class was unable to accept data from `jax.numpy.array` 
  inputs when specifying the angle, due to the given hashing policy. The implementation was updated 
  to ensure correct hashing behavior for `float`, `numpy.array`, and `jax.numpy.array` inputs.
  [(#7693)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7693)

* A bug in `qml.draw_mpl` for circuits with work wires has been fixed. The previously inconsistent 
  mapping for these wires has been resolved, ensuring accurate assignment during drawing.
  [(#7668)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7668)

* A bug in `ops.op_math.Prod.simplify()` has been fixed that led to global phases being discarded
  in special cases. Concretely, this problem occurs when Pauli factors combine into the identity
  up to a global phase _and_ there is no Pauli representation of the product operator.
  [(#7671)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7671)

* The behaviour of the `qml.FlipSign` operation has been fixed: passing an integer `m` as the wires 
  argument is now interpreted as a single wire (i.e. `wires=[m]`). This is different from the 
  previous interpretation of `wires=range(m)`. 
  Also, the `qml.FlipSign.wires` attribute is now returning the correct `Wires` object as for all other operations in PennyLane.
  [(#7647)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7647)

* `qml.equal` now works with `qml.PauliError`s.
  [(#7618)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7618)

* The `qml.transforms.cancel_inverses` transform can now be used with `jax.jit`.
  [(#7487)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7487)

* `qml.StatePrep` no longer validates the norm of statevectors.
  [(#7615)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7615)

* The `qml.PhaseShift` operation is now working correctly with a batch size of 1.
  [(#7622)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7622)

* `qml.metric_tensor` can now be calculated with Catalyst present.
  [(#7528)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7528)

* The mapping to standard wires (consecutive integers) of `qml.tape.QuantumScript` has been fixed
  to correctly consider work wires that are not used otherwise in the circuit.
  [(#7581)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7581)

* Fixed a bug where certain transforms with a native program capture implementation give incorrect 
  results when dynamic wires were present in the circuit. The affected transforms were:
  * :func:`~.transforms.cancel_inverses`
  * :func:`~.transforms.merge_rotations`
  * :func:`~.transforms.single_qubit_fusion`
  * :func:`~.transforms.merge_amplitude_embedding`
  [(#7426)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7426)

* The `Operator.pow` method has been fixed to raise to the power of 2 the qutrit operators 
  `~.TShift`, `~.TClock`, and `~.TAdd`.
  [(#7505)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7505)

* The queuing behavior of the controlled of a controlled operation has been fixed.
  [(#7532)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7532)

* A new decomposition was implemented for two-qubit `QubitUnitary` operators in 
  `two_qubit_decomposition` based on a type-AI Cartan decomposition. It fixes previously faulty edge 
  cases for unitaries that require 2 or 3 CNOT gates. Now, 3 CNOTs are used for both cases, using 
  one more CNOT than theoretically required in the former case.
  [(#7474)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7474)

* Fixed a bug in `to_openfermion` where identity qubit-to-wires mapping was not obeyed.
  [(#7332)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7332)

* Fixed a bug in the validation of :class:`~.SelectPauliRot` that prevents parameter broadcasting.
  [(#7377)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7377)

* Usage of NumPy in `default.mixed` source code has been converted to `qml.math` to avoid
  unnecessary dependency on NumPy and to fix a bug that caused an error when using `default.mixed` 
  with PyTorch and GPUs.
  [(#7384)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7384)

* With program capture enabled (`qml.capture.enable()`), `QSVT` no longer treats abstract values as 
  metadata.
  [(#7360)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7360)

* A fix was made to `default.qubit` to allow for using `qml.Snapshot` with defer-measurements 
  (`mcm_method="deferred"`).
  [(#7335)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7335)

* Fixed the repr for empty `Prod` and `Sum` instances to better communicate the existence of an 
  empty instance.
  [(#7346)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7346)

* Fixed a bug where circuit execution fails with ``BlockEncode`` initialized with sparse matrices.
  [(#7285)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7285)

* An informative error message has been added if `qml.cond` is used with an abstract condition with
  jitting on `default.qubit` when program capture is enabled.
  [(#7314)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7314)

* Fixed a bug where using a ``StatePrep`` operation with `batch_size=1` did not work with 
  ``default.mixed``.
  [(#7280)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7280)

* Gradient transforms can now be used in conjunction with batch transforms with all interfaces.
  [(#7287)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7287)

* Fixed a bug where the global phase was not being added in the ``QubitUnitary`` decomposition.  
  [(#7244)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7244)
  [(#7270)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7270)

* Using finite differences with program capture without x64 mode enabled now raises a warning.
  [(#7282)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7282)

* When the `mcm_method` is specified to the `"device"`, the `defer_measurements` transform will 
  no longer be applied. Instead, the device will be responsible for all MCM handling.
  [(#7243)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7243)

* Fixed coverage of `qml.liealg.CII` and `qml.liealg.AIII`.
  [(#7291)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7291)

* Fixed a bug where the phase is used as the wire label for a `qml.GlobalPhase` when capture is 
  enabled.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

* Fixed a bug that caused `CountsMP.process_counts` to return results in the computational basis, 
  even if an observable was specified.
  [(#7342)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7342)

* Fixed a bug that caused `SamplesMP.process_counts` used with an observable to return a list of 
  eigenvalues for each individual operation in the observable, instead of the overall result.
  [(#7342)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7342)

* Fixed a bug where `two_qubit_decomposition` provides an incorrect decomposition for some special 
  matrices.
  [(#7340)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7340)

* Fixed a bug where the powers of `qml.ISWAP` and `qml.SISWAP` were decomposed incorrectly.
  [(#7361)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7361)

* Returning `MeasurementValue`s from the `ftqc` module's parametric mid-circuit measurements
  (`measure_arbitrary_basis`, `measure_x` and `measure_y`) no longer raises an error in circuits 
  using `diagonalize_mcms`.
  [(#7387)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7387)

* Fixed a bug where the :func:`~.transforms.single_qubit_fusion` transform produces a tape that is
  off from the original tape by a global phase.
  [(#7619)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7619)

* Fixed a bug where an error is raised from the decomposition graph when the resource params of an operator contains lists.
  [(#7722)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7722)

* Fixed a bug with the new `Select` decomposition based on unary iteration. There was an erroneous `print` statement.
  [(#7842)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7842)

* Fixes a bug where an operation wrapped in `partial_wires` does not get queued.
  [(#7830)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7830)
