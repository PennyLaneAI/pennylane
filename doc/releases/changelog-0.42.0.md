# Release 0.42.0

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h4>State-of-the-art templates and decompositions 🐝</h4>

* A new decomposition using [unary iteration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03662) has been added to :class:`~.Select`.
  This state-of-the-art decomposition reduces the :class:`~.T`-count significantly, and uses :math:`c-1` auxiliary wires,
  where :math:`c` is the number of control wires of the `Select` operator.
  [(#7623)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7623)
  [(#7744)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7744)
  [(#7842)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7842)

  Unary iteration leverages auxiliary wires to store intermediate values for reuse among the 
  different multi-controlled operators, avoiding unnecessary recomputation and leading to more 
  efficient decompositions to elementary gates. This decomposition uses a template called
  :class:`~.TemporaryAND`, which was also added in this release (see the next changelog entry).
  
  This decomposition rule for :class:`~.Select` is available when the graph-based
  decomposition system is enabled via :func:`~.decomposition.enable_graph`:

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml
  from functools import partial

  qml.decomposition.enable_graph()
  ```

  To demonstrate the resource-efficiency of this new decomposition, let's use 
  :func:`~.transforms.decompose` to decompose an instance of :class:`~.Select` using the new unary iterator decomposition rule, and further decompose these gates into the Clifford+T gate set
  using :func:`~.clifford_t_decomposition` so that we can count the number of `T` gates required:
  
  ```python
  reg = qml.registers({"targ": 2, "control": 2, "work": 1})
  targ, control, work = (reg[k] for k in reg.keys())

  dev = qml.device('default.qubit')
  ops = [qml.X(targ[0]), qml.X(targ[1]), qml.Y(targ[0]), qml.SWAP(targ)]

  @qml.clifford_t_decomposition
  @partial(qml.transforms.decompose, gate_set={
          qml.X, qml.CNOT, qml.TemporaryAND, "Adjoint(TemporaryAND)", "CY", "CSWAP"
      }
  )
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.Select(ops, control=control, work_wires=work)
      return qml.state()
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> unary_specs = qml.specs(circuit)()
  >>> print(unary_specs['resources'].gate_types["T"])
  16
  >>> print(unary_specs['resources'].gate_types["Adjoint(T)"])
  13
  ```

  Go check out the *Unary iterator decomposition* section in the :class:`~.Select` documentation for 
  more information!

* A new template called :class:`~.TemporaryAND` has been added. :class:`~.TemporaryAND` enables more 
  efficient circuit decompositions, such as the newest decomposition of the :class:`~.Select` template.
  [(#7472)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7472)

  The :class:`~.TemporaryAND` operation is a three-qubit gate equivalent to a logical ``AND`` operation 
  (or a reversible :class:`~.Toffoli`): it assumes that the target qubit is initialized in the 
  ``|0〉`` state, while ``Adjoint(TemporaryAND)`` assumes the target qubit will be output into the 
  ``|0〉`` state. For more details, see Fig. 4 in [arXiv:1805.03662](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03662).

  ```python
  from functools import partial

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

  @partial(qml.set_shots, shots=1)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      # |0000⟩
      qml.X(0) # |1000⟩
      qml.X(1) # |1100⟩
      # The target wire is in state |0>, so we can apply TemporaryAND
      qml.TemporaryAND([0, 1, 2]) # |1110⟩
      qml.CNOT([2, 3]) # |1111⟩
      # The target wire will be in state |0> after adjoint(TemporaryAND) gate is applied
      # so we can apply adjoint(TemporaryAND)
      qml.adjoint(qml.TemporaryAND([0, 1, 2])) # |1101⟩
      return qml.sample(wires=[0, 1, 2, 3])
  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> print(circuit())
  [1 1 0 1]
  ```

* A new template called :class:`~.SemiAdder` has been added, which provides state-of-the-art 
  resource-efficiency (fewer :class:`~.T` gates) when performing addition on a quantum computer.
  [(#7494)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7494)

  Based on [arXiv:1709.06648](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06648), :class:`~.SemiAdder` performs the plain 
  addition of two integers in the computational basis. Here is an example of performing `3 + 4 = 7`
  with 5 additional work wires:

  ```python
  from functools import partial

  x = 3
  y = 4

  wires = qml.registers({"x": 3, "y": 6, "work": 5})

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

  @partial(qml.set_shots, shots=1)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.BasisEmbedding(x, wires=wires["x"])
      qml.BasisEmbedding(y, wires=wires["y"])
      qml.SemiAdder(wires["x"], wires["y"], wires["work"])
      return qml.sample(wires=wires["y"])
  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> print(circuit()) 
  [0 0 0 1 1 1]
  ```

  The result `[0 0 0 1 1 1]` is the binary representation of `7`.

* A new template called :class:`~.SelectPauliRot` is available, which applies a sequence of 
  uniformly controlled rotations on a target qubit. This operator appears frequently in unitary 
  decompositions and block-encoding techniques. 
  [(#7206)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7206)
  [(#7617)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7617)

  As input, :class:`~.SelectPauliRot` requires the `angles` of rotation to be applied to the target 
  qubit for each control register configuration, as well as the `control_wires`, the `target_wire`,
  and the axis of rotation (`rot_axis`) for which each rotation is performed (the default is the `"Z"` 
  axis).

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  angles = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])

  wires = qml.registers({"control": 2, "target": 1})
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.SelectPauliRot(
        angles,
        control_wires=wires["control"],
        target_wire=wires["target"],
        rot_axis="Z"
      )
      return qml.state()
  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit, level="device")())
  0: ─────────────────────────╭●───────────────╭●─┤ ╭State
  1: ───────────╭●────────────│──╭●────────────│──┤ ├State
  2: ──RZ(2.50)─╰X──RZ(-0.50)─╰X─╰X──RZ(-1.00)─╰X─┤ ╰State
  ```

* The decompositions of :class:`~.SingleExcitation`, :class:`~.SingleExcitationMinus` and 
  :class:`~.SingleExcitationPlus` have been made more efficient by reducing the number of rotations 
  gates and ``CNOT``, ``CZ``, and ``CY`` gates (where applicable). This leads to lower circuit depth 
  when decomposing these gates.
  [(#7771)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7771)

<h4>QSVT & QSP angle solver for large polynomials 🕸️</h4>

Effortlessly perform QSVT and QSP with polynomials of large degrees, using our new iterative angle 
solver.

* A new iterative angle solver for QSVT and QSP is available in the 
  :func:`poly_to_angles <pennylane.poly_to_angles>` function, designed for angle computation for 
  polynomials with degrees larger than 1000.
  [(6694)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6694)

  Simply set `angle_solver="iterative"` in the :func:`poly_to_angles  <pennylane.poly_to_angles>` 
  function to use it.

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # P(x) = x - 0.5 x^3 + 0.25 x^5
  poly = np.array([0, 1.0, 0, -1/2, 0, 1/4])

  qsvt_angles = qml.poly_to_angles(poly, "QSVT", angle_solver="iterative")
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qsvt_angles)
  [-4.72195208  1.59759022  1.12953398  1.12953403  1.59759046 -0.00956271]
  ```

  This functionality can also be accessed directly from :func:`qml.qsvt <pennylane.qsvt>` with the 
  same keyword argument:

  ```python
  # P(x) = -x + 0.5 x^3 + 0.5 x^5
  poly = np.array([0, -1, 0, 0.5, 0, 0.5])

  hamiltonian = qml.dot([0.3, 0.7], [qml.Z(1), qml.X(1) @ qml.Z(2)])

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit")
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.qsvt(
          hamiltonian, poly, encoding_wires=[0], block_encoding="prepselprep", angle_solver="iterative"
      )
      return qml.state()

  matrix = qml.matrix(circuit, wire_order=[0, 1, 2])()
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(matrix[:4, :4].real)
  [[-0.16253996  0.         -0.37925991  0.        ]
   [ 0.         -0.16253996  0.          0.37925991]
   [-0.37925991  0.          0.16253996  0.        ]
   [ 0.          0.37925991  0.          0.16253996]]
  ```

<h4>Qualtran integration 🔗</h4>

* It's now possible to convert PennyLane circuits and operators to 
  [Qualtran](https://qualtran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) circuits and Bloqs with the new 
  :func:`qml.to_bloq <pennylane.to_bloq>` function. This function translates PennyLane circuits (qfuncs or 
  QNodes) and operations into equivalent
  [Qualtran bloqs](https://qualtran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bloqs/index.html#bloqs-library), 
  enabling a new way to estimate 
  the resource requirements of PennyLane quantum circuits via Qualtran's abstractions and tools. 
  [(#7197)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7197)
  [(#7604)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7604)
  [(#7536)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7536)
  [(#7814)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7814)

  :func:`qml.to_bloq <pennylane.to_bloq>` can be used in the following ways:

  * Wrap PennyLane circuits and operations to give them Qualtran features, like obtaining
    [bloq_counts](https://qualtran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/qualtran/Bloq.html#:~:text=bloq_counts) 
    and drawing a 
    [call_graph](https://qualtran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/drawing/drawing_call_graph.html), but 
    preserve PennyLane's definition of the circuit/operator. This is done by setting `map_ops` to `False`, 
    which instead wraps operations as a :class:`~.ToBloq`:
  
    ```pycon
    >>> def circuit():
    ...     qml.X(0)
    ...     qml.Y(1)
    ...     qml.Z(2)
    ...
    >>> cbloq = qml.to_bloq(circuit, map_ops=False)
    >>> type(cbloq)
    pennylane.io.qualtran_io.ToBloq
    >>> cbloq.bloq_counts()
    {XGate(): 1, ZGate(): 1, YGate(): 1}
    ```

  * Use smart default mapping of PennyLane circuits and operations to Qualtran Bloqs by setting 
    `map_ops=True` (the default value):

    ```pycon
    >>> PL_op = qml.X(0)
    >>> qualtran_op = qml.to_bloq(PL_op)
    >>> type(qualtran_op)
    qualtran.bloqs.basic_gates.x_basis.XGate
    ```

  * Use custom user-defined mapping of PennyLane circuits and operations to Qualtran Bloqs by 
    setting a `custom_mapping` dictionary:

    ```python
    from qualtran.bloqs.basic_gates import XGate

    def circuit():
        qml.QubitUnitary([[0, 1],[1, 0]], wires=0)
        qml.QubitUnitary([[0, 1],[1, 0]], wires=0)
        qml.QubitUnitary([[0, 1],[1, 0]], wires=0)
    ```

    ```pycon
    >>> PL_op = qml.QubitUnitary([[0, 1],[1, 0]], wires=0)
    >>> qualtran_op = XGate()
    >>> custom_map = {PL_op: qualtran_op}
    >>> bloq = qml.to_bloq(circuit, custom_mapping=custom_map)
    >>> bloq.bloq_counts()
    {XGate(): 3}
    ```

<h4>Resource-efficient Clifford-T decompositions 🍃</h4>

* The [Ross-Selinger algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2975),
  also known as Gridsynth, can now be accessed in :func:`~.clifford_t_decomposition` by setting
  `method="gridsynth"`. This is a newer Clifford-T decomposition method that can produce orders of 
  magnitude fewer gates than using `method="sk"` (Solovay-Kitaev algorithm). 
  [(#7588)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7588)
  [(#7641)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7641)
  [(#7611)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7611)
  [(#7711)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7711)
  [(#7770)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7770)
  [(#7791)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7791)

  In the following example, decomposing with `method="gridsynth"` instead of `method="sk"` gives a
  significant reduction in overall gate counts, specifically the :class:`~.T` count:

  ```python
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2))
  def circuit():

      qml.RX(0.12, 0)
      qml.CNOT([0, 1])
      qml.RY(0.34, 0)

      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
  ```

  We can inspect the gate counts resulting from both decomposition methods with :func:`~.specs`:

  ```pycon
  >>> gridsynth_circuit = qml.clifford_t_decomposition(circuit, method="gridsynth")
  >>> sk_circuit = qml.clifford_t_decomposition(circuit, method="sk")
  >>> gridsynth_specs = qml.specs(gridsynth_circuit)()["resources"]
  >>> sk_specs = qml.specs(sk_circuit)()["resources"]
  >>> print(gridsynth_specs.num_gates, sk_specs.num_gates)
  239 47942
  >>> print(gridsynth_specs.gate_types['T'], sk_specs.gate_types['T'])
  90 8044
  ```

<h4>OpenQASM 🤝 PennyLane</h4>

PennyLane now offers improved support for [OpenQASM 2.0 & 3.0](https://openqasm.com/).

* Use the new :func:`qml.from_qasm3 <pennylane.from_qasm3>` function to convert your OpenQASM 3.0 
  circuits into quantum functions which can then be loaded into QNodes and executed.

              i = i + 1;
              rz(i) q1;
              break;

          }
          """,
          {'q0': 0, 'q1': 1, 'q2': 2},
      )()
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(my_circuit)())
  0: ──RY(0.10)──X²────────────┤  <Z>

  2: ──H─────────┤↗├──║────────┤     
                  ╚═══╝      
  ```
  
  Some gates and operations in OpenQASM 3.0 programs are not currently supported. For more details, please consult the documentation
  for :func:`qml.from_qasm3 <pennylane.from_qasm3>` and ensure that you have installed `openqasm3` and `'openqasm3[parser]'`
  in your environment by following the [OpenQASM 3.0 installation instructions](https://pypi.org/project/openqasm3/).

* The new :func:`qml.to_openqasm <pennylane.to_openqasm>` function enables conversion of PennyLane 
  circuits to OpenQASM 2.0 programs.
  [(#7393)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7393)

  Consider this simple circuit in PennyLane:

  ```python
  from functools import partial

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

  @partial(qml.set_shots, shots=100)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(theta, phi):
      qml.RX(theta, wires=0)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0,1])
      qml.RZ(phi, wires=1)
      return qml.sample()
  ```

  This can be easily converted to OpenQASM 2.0 with :func:`qml.to_openqasm <pennylane.to_openqasm>`:
  
  ```pycon
  >>> openqasm_circ = qml.to_openqasm(circuit)(1.2, 0.9)
  >>> print(openqasm_circ)
  OPENQASM 2.0;
  include "qelib1.inc";
  qreg q[2];
  creg c[2];
  rx(1.2) q[0];
  cx q[0],q[1];
  rz(0.9) q[1];
  measure q[0] -> c[0];
  measure q[1] -> c[1];
  ```

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

<h4>A quantum optimizer that works with QJIT</h4>

* Leveraging quantum just-in-time compilation to optimize parameterized hybrid workflows with the quantum 
  natural gradient optimizer is now possible with the new :class:`~.QNGOptimizerQJIT` optimizer. 
  [(#7452)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7452)
  
  The :class:`~.QNGOptimizerQJIT` optimizer offers a `jax.jit`- and :func:`qml.qjit <pennylane.qjit>`-compatible analogue to the existing 
  :class:`~.QNGOptimizer` with an Optax-like interface:

  ```python
  import jax.numpy as jnp

  @qml.qjit(autograph=True)
  def workflow():
      dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)
  
      @qml.qnode(dev)
      def circuit(params):
          qml.RX(params[0], wires=0)
          qml.RY(params[1], wires=1)
          return qml.expval(qml.Z(0) + qml.X(1))
  
      opt = qml.QNGOptimizerQJIT(stepsize=0.2)
  
      params = jnp.array([0.1, 0.2])
      state = opt.init(params)
      for _ in range(100):
          params, state = opt.step(circuit, params, state)
  
      return params
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> workflow()
  Array([ 3.14159265, -1.57079633], dtype=float64)
  ```

<h4>Resource-efficient decompositions 🔎</h4>

* With graph-based decomposition enabled via :func:`~.decomposition.enable_graph`, the 
  :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform now supports weighting gates in the target `gate_set`, 
  allowing for preferential treatment of certain gates in a target `gate_set` over others.
  [(#7389)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7389)

  Gates specified in `gate_set` can be given a numerical weight associated with their effective cost 
  to have in a circuit:
  
  * Gate weights that are greater than 1 indicate a *greater cost* (less preferred).
  * Gate weights that are less than 1 indicate a *lower cost* (more preferred).

  Consider the following toy example, where `CZ` gates are highly preferred to decompose into, but
  `H` and `CRZ` gates are quite costly.

  ```python
  from functools import partial

  qml.decomposition.enable_graph()
  
  @partial(
      qml.transforms.decompose, gate_set={
          qml.Toffoli: 1.23, qml.RX: 4.56, qml.CZ: 0.01, qml.H: 420, qml.CRZ: 100
      }
  )
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
  def circuit():
      qml.CRX(0.1, wires=[0, 1])
      qml.Toffoli(wires=[0, 1, 2])
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())

  0: ───────────╭●────────────╭●─╭●─┤  <Z>
  1: ──RX(0.05)─╰Z──RX(-0.05)─╰Z─├●─┤     
  2: ────────────────────────────╰X─┤     
  ```

  By reducing the `H` and `CRZ` weights, the circuit decomposition changes:

  ```python
  qml.decomposition.enable_graph()

  @partial(
      qml.transforms.decompose, gate_set={
          qml.Toffoli: 1.23, qml.RX: 4.56, qml.CZ: 0.01, qml.H: 0.1, qml.CRZ: 0.1
      }
  )
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
  def circuit():
      qml.CRX(0.1, wires=[0, 1])
      qml.Toffoli(wires=[0, 1, 2])
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())

  0: ────╭●───────────╭●─┤  <Z>
  1: ──H─╰RZ(0.10)──H─├●─┤     
  2: ─────────────────╰X─┤  
  ```

* Decomposition rules that can be accessed with the new graph-based decomposition system have been
  implemented for the following operators:

  * :class:`~.QubitUnitary`
    [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

  * :class:`~.ControlledQubitUnitary`
    [(#7371)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7371)

  * :class:`~.DiagonalQubitUnitary`
    [(#7625)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7625)

  * :class:`~.MultiControlledX`
    [(#7405)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7405)

  * :class:`~.ops.Exp` 
    [(#7489)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7489)
    Specifically, the following decompositions have been added:
    
    - Suzuki-Trotter decomposition when the `num_steps` keyword argument is specified.
    - Decomposition to a :class:`~.PauliRot` when the base is a single-term Pauli word.

  * :class:`~.PCPhase`
    [(#7591)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7591)

  * :class:`~.QuantumPhaseEstimation`
    [(#7637)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7637)

  * :class:`~.BasisRotation`
    [(#7074)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7074)

  * :class:`~.PhaseAdder`
    [(#7070)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7070)

  * :class:`~.IntegerComparator`
    [(#7636)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7636)

* With graph-based decomposition enabled with :func:`~.decomposition.enable_graph`, a new 
  decomposition rule that uses a single work wire for decomposing multi-controlled operators can be
  accessed.
  [(#7383)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7383)

* With graph-based decomposition enabled with :func:`~.decomposition.enable_graph`, a new decorator 
  called :func:`~.decomposition.register_condition` can be used to bind a condition to a 
  decomposition rule denoting when it is applicable.
  [(#7439)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7439)

  The condition should be a function that takes the resource parameters of an operator as arguments 
  and returns `True` or `False` based on whether these parameters satisfy the condition for when 
  this rule can be applied.

  Here is an example of adding a decomposition rule to :class:`~.QubitUnitary`, where the condition
  for which this decomposition rule applies is when the number of wires :class:`~.QubitUnitary` acts
  on is exactly one:

  ```python
  from pennylane.math.decomposition import zyz_rotation_angles
  
  qml.decomposition.enable_graph()

  # The parameters must be consistent with ``qml.QubitUnitary.resource_keys``
  def _zyz_condition(num_wires):
    return num_wires == 1

  @qml.register_condition(_zyz_condition)
  @qml.register_resources({qml.RZ: 2, qml.RY: 1, qml.GlobalPhase: 1})
  def zyz_decomposition(U, wires, **__):
      # Assumes that U is a 2x2 unitary matrix
      phi, theta, omega, phase = zyz_rotation_angles(U, return_global_phase=True)
      qml.RZ(phi, wires=wires[0])
      qml.RY(theta, wires=wires[0])
      qml.RZ(omega, wires=wires[0])
      qml.GlobalPhase(-phase)
  
  # This decomposition will be ignored for `QubitUnitary` on more than one wire.
  qml.add_decomps(qml.QubitUnitary, zyz_decomposition)
  ```

* Symbolic operator types (e.g., `Adjoint`, `Controlled`, and `Pow`) can now be specified as strings
  in various parts of the new graph-based decomposition system:

  * The `gate_set` argument of the :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform now supports adding 
    symbolic operators in the target gate set.
    [(#7331)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7331)

    ```python
    from functools import partial

    qml.decomposition.enable_graph()
    
    @partial(qml.transforms.decompose, gate_set={"T", "Adjoint(T)", "H", "CNOT"})
    @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
    def circuit():
        qml.Toffoli(wires=[0, 1, 2])
    ```
    ```pycon
    >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())
    0: ───────────╭●───────────╭●────╭●──T──╭●─┤
    1: ────╭●─────│─────╭●─────│───T─╰X──T†─╰X─┤
    2: ──H─╰X──T†─╰X──T─╰X──T†─╰X──T──H────────┤
    ```

  * Symbolic operator types can now be given as strings to the `op_type` argument of 
    :func:`~.decomposition.add_decomps`, or as keys of the dictionaries passed to the `alt_decomps` 
    and `fixed_decomps` arguments of the :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform, allowing custom 
    decomposition rules to be defined and registered for symbolic operators.

        return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
    ```

    0: ──RX(-0.50)─╭●────────────┤  <Z>
    1: ────────────╰X──RY(-0.50)─┤
    ```

* A `work_wire_type` argument has been added to :func:`~pennylane.ctrl` and 
  :class:`~pennylane.ControlledQubitUnitary` for more fine-grained control over the type of work 
  wire used in their decompositions.
  [(#7612)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7612)

* The :func:`~.transforms.decompose` transform now accepts a `stopping_condition` argument with 
  graph-based decomposition enabled, which must be a function that returns `True` if an operator 
  does not need to be decomposed (it meets the requirements as described in `stopping_condition`).
  See the documentation for more details.
  [(#7531)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7531)

* Two-qubit `QubitUnitary` gates no longer decompose into fundamental rotation gates; it now 
  decomposes into single-qubit `QubitUnitary` gates. This allows the graph-based decomposition 
  system to further decompose single-qubit unitary gates more flexibly using different rotations.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

* A new decomposition for two-qubit unitaries has been implemented in :func:`~.ops.two_qubit_decomposition`.
  It ensures the correctness of the decomposition in some edge cases but uses 3 CNOT gates even if 2 CNOTs
  would suffice theoretically.
  [(#7474)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7474)

* The `gate_set` argument of :func:`~.transforms.decompose` now accepts `"X"`, `"Y"`, `"Z"`, `"H"`, 
  `"I"` as aliases for `"PauliX"`, `"PauliY"`, `"PauliZ"`, `"Hadamard"`, and `"Identity"`. These 
  aliases are also recognized as part of symbolic operators. For example, `"Adjoint(H)"` is now 
  accepted as an alias for `"Adjoint(Hadamard)"`.
  [(#7331)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7331)

<h4>Setting shots 🔁</h4>

* A new QNode transform called :func:`~.transforms.set_shots` has been added to set or update the 
  number of shots to be performed, overriding shots specified in the device.
  [(#7337)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7337)
  [(#7358)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7358)
  [(#7415)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7415)
  [(#7500)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7500)
  [(#7627)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7627)

  The :func:`~.workflow.set_shots` transform can be used as a decorator:

  ```python
  @partial(qml.set_shots, shots=2)
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit", wires=1))
  def circuit():
      qml.RX(1.23, wires=0)
      return qml.sample(qml.Z(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit()
  array([1., -1.])
  ```
  
  Or, it can be used in-line to update a circuit's `shots`:

  ```pycon
  >>> new_circ = qml.set_shots(circuit, shots=(4, 10)) # shot vector
  >>> new_circ()
  (array([-1.,  1., -1.,  1.]), array([ 1.,  1.,  1., -1.,  1.,  1., -1., -1.,  1.,  1.]))
  ```

<h4>QChem</h4>

* The `qchem` module has been upgraded with new functions to construct a vibrational Hamiltonian in 
  the Christiansen representation. 
  [(#7491)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7491)
  [(#7596)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7596)
  [(#7785)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7785)

  The new functions :func:`christiansen_hamiltonian` and :func:`qml.qchem.christiansen_bosonic` can
  be used to create the qubit and bosonic form of the Christiansen Hamiltonian, respectively. These
  functions need input parameters that can be easily obtained by using the
  :func:`christiansen_integrals` and :func:`vibrational_pes` functions. Similarly, a Christiansen
  dipole operator can be created by using the :func:`christiansen_dipole` and
  :func:`christiansen_integrals_dipole` functions.

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  symbols  = ['H', 'F']
  geometry = np.array([[0.0, 0.0, -0.40277116], [0.0, 0.0, 1.40277116]])
  mol = qml.qchem.Molecule(symbols, geometry)
  pes = qml.qchem.vibrational_pes(mol, optimize=False)
  ham = qml.qchem.vibrational.christiansen_hamiltonian(pes, n_states = 4)
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> ham

<h4>Experimental FTQC module</h4>

* Commutation rules for a Clifford gate set (`qml.H`, `qml.S`, `qml.CNOT`) have been added to the 
  `ftqc.pauli_tracker` module, accessible via the `commute_clifford_op` function.
  [(#7444)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7444)

* Offline byproduct correction support has been added to the `ftqc` module.
  [(#7447)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7447)

* The `ftqc` module `measure_arbitrary_basis`, `measure_x` and `measure_y` functions can now be 
  captured when program capture is enabled.
  [(#7219)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7219)
  [(#7368)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7368)

* Functions called `pauli_to_xz`, `xz_to_pauli` and `pauli_prod` that are related to `xz`-encoding 
  have been added to the `ftqc` module.
  [(#7433)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7433)

* A new transform called `convert_to_mbqc_formalism` has been added to the `ftqc` module to convert 
  a circuit already expressed in a limited, compatible gate set into the MBQC formalism. Circuits 
  can be converted to the relevant gate set with the `convert_to_mbqc_gateset` transform.
  [(#7355)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7355)
  [(#7586)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7586)

* The `RotXZX` operation has been added to the `ftqc` module to support the definition of a 
  universal gate set that can be translated to the MBQC formalism.
  [(#7271)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7271)

<h4>Other improvements</h4>

* `qml.evolve` now errors out if the first argument is not a valid type.
  [(#7768)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7768)

* `qml.PauliError` now accepts Pauli strings that include the identity operator.
  [(#7760)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7760)

* Caching with finite shots now always warns about the lack of expected noise.
  [(#7644)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7644)

* `cache` now defaults to `"auto"` with `qml.execute`, matching the behavior of `QNode` and 
  increasing the performance of using `qml.execute` for standard executions.
  [(#7644)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7644)

* `qml.grad` and `qml.jacobian` can now handle inputs with dynamic shapes being captured into plxpr.
  [(#7544)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7544/)

* The drawing of `GlobalPhase`, `ctrl(GlobalPhase)`, `Identity` and `ctrl(Identity)` operations has 
  been improved. The labels are grouped together as in other multi-qubit operations, and the drawing 
  no longer depends on the wires of `GlobalPhase` or `Identity`. Control nodes of controlled global 
  phases and identities no longer receive the operator label, which is in line with other controlled 
  operations.
  [(#7457)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7457)

* The decomposition of :class:`~.PCPhase` is now significantly more efficient for more than 2 qubits.
  [(#7166)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7166)

* The decomposition of :class:`~.IntegerComparator` is now significantly more efficient.
  [(#7636)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7636)

* :class:`~.QubitUnitary` now supports a decomposition that is compatible with an arbitrary number 
  of qubits. This represents a fundamental improvement over the previous implementation, which was
  limited to two-qubit systems.
  [(#7277)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7277)

* Setting up the configuration of a workflow, including the determination of the best diff method, 
  is now done *after* user transforms have been applied. This allows transforms to update the shots 
  and change measurement processes with fewer issues.
  [(#7358)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7358)
  [(#7461)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7461)

* The decomposition of `DiagonalQubitUnitary` has been updated from a recursive decomposition into a 
  smaller `DiagonalQubitUnitary` and a `SelectPauliRot` operation. This is a known decomposition 
  from [Theorem 7 in Shende et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406176) that contains fewer 
  gates.
  [(#7370)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7370)
 
* An experimental integration for a Python compiler using [xDSL](https://xdsl.dev/index) has been introduced.
  This is similar to 
  [Catalyst's MLIR dialects](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/stable/dev/dialects.html#mlir-dialects-in-catalyst), 
  but it is coded in Python instead of C++. Compiler passes written using xDSL can be registered as 
  compatible passes via the `@compiler_transform` decorator.

* An xDSL pass called `qml.compiler.python_compiler.transforms.MergeRotationsPass` has been added 
  for applying `merge_rotations` to an xDSL module for the experimental xDSL Python compiler 
  integration.

  [(#7595)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7595)
  [(#7664)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7664)

* An xDSL pass called `qml.compiler.python_compiler.transforms.IterativeCancelInversesPass` has been 
  added for applying `cancel_inverses` iteratively to an xDSL module for the experimental xDSL 
  Python compiler integration. This pass is optimized to cancel self-inverse operations iteratively.
  [(#7363)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7363)
  [(#7595)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7595)

* PennyLane now supports `jax == 0.6.0` and `0.5.3`.
  [(#6919)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6919)
  [(#7299)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7299)

* The alias for `Identity` (`I`) is now accessible from `qml.ops`.
  [(#7200)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7200)
  
* A new `allocation` module containing `allocate` and `deallocate` instructions has been added for 
  requesting dynamic wires. This is currently experimental and not integrated into any execution 
  pipelines.
  [(#7704)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7704)
  [(#7710)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7710)

* Computing the angles for uniformly controlled rotations, used in 
  :class:`~.MottonenStatePreparation` and :class:`~.SelectPauliRot` now takes much less 
  computational effort and memory.
  [(#7377)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7377)

* Classical shadows with mixed quantum states are now computed with a dedicated method that uses an
  iterative algorithm similar to the handling of shadows with state vectors. This makes shadows with 
  density matrices much more performant.
  [(#7458)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7458)

* Two new functions called :func:`~.math.convert_to_su2` and :func:`~.math.convert_to_su4` have been 
  added to `qml.math`, which convert unitary matrices to SU(2) or SU(4), respectively, and 
  optionally a global phase.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

* `Operator.num_wires` now defaults to `None` to indicate that the operator can be on any number of 
  wires.
  [(#7312)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7312)

* Shots can now be overridden for specific `qml.Snapshot` instances via a `shots` keyword argument.
  [(#7326)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7326)

  ```python
  from functools import partial

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

  @partial(qml.set_shots, shots=10)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.Snapshot("sample", measurement=qml.sample(qml.X(0)), shots=5)
      return qml.sample(qml.X(0))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.snapshots(circuit)()
  {'sample': array([-1., -1., -1., -1., -1.]),
   'execution_results': array([ 1., -1., -1., -1., -1.,  1., -1., -1.,  1., -1.])}
  ```

* PennyLane no longer validates that an operation has at least one wire, as having this check 
  reduced performance by requiring the abstract interface to maintain a list of special 
  implementations.
  [(#7327)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7327)

* Two new device-developer transforms have been added to `devices.preprocess`: 
  :func:`~.devices.preprocess.measurements_from_counts` and 
  :func:`~.devices.preprocess.measurements_from_samples`.
  These transforms modify the tape to instead contain a `counts` or `sample` measurement process, 
  deriving the original measurements from the raw counts/samples in post-processing. This allows 
  expanded measurement support for devices that only support counts/samples at execution, like real 
  hardware devices.
  [(#7317)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7317)

* The Sphinx version was updated to 8.1. 
  [(7212)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7212)

* The `setup.py` package build and install has been migrated to `pyproject.toml`.
  [(#7375)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7375)

* GitHub actions and workflows (`rtd.yml`, `readthedocs.yml`, and `docs.yml`) have been updated to 
  use `ubuntu-24.04` runners.
  [(#7396)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7396)

* The requirements and pyproject files have been updated to include other packages.  
  [(#7417)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7417)

* Documentation checks have been updated to remove duplicate docstring references. 
  [(#7453)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7453)

* The performance of `qml.clifford_t_decomposition` has been improved by introducing caching support 
  and changing the default basis set of `qml.ops.sk_decomposition` to `(H, S, T)`, resulting in 
  shorter decomposition sequences.
  [(#7454)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7454)

* The decomposition of `qml.BasisState` with capture and the graph-based decomposition systems 
  enabled is more efficient.
  [(#7722)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7722)

<h3>Labs: a place for unified and rapid prototyping of research software 🧪</h3>

* The imports of dependencies introduced by ``labs`` functionalities have been modified such that
  these dependencies only have to be installed for the functions that use them, not to use
  ``labs`` functionalities in general. This decouples the various submodules, and even functions
  within the same submodule, from each other.
  [(#7650)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7650)

* A new module called :mod:`qml.labs.intermediate_reps <pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps>` has been 
  added to provide functionality to compute intermediate representations for particular circuits.
  The :func:`parity_matrix <pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps.parity_matrix>` function computes
  the parity matrix intermediate representation for `CNOT` circuits, and the
  :func:`phase_polynomial <pennylane.labs.intermediate_reps.phase_polynomial>` function computes
  the phase polynomial intermediate representation for `{CNOT, RZ}` circuits. These efficient 
  intermediate representations are important for CNOT routing algorithms and other quantum 
  compilation routines.

* The `pennylane.labs.vibrational` module has been upgraded to use features from the `concurrency` 
  module to perform multiprocess and multithreaded execution. 
  [(#7401)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7401)

* A `rowcol` function is now available in `qml.labs.intermediate_reps`. Given the parity matrix of a 
  `CNOT` circuit and a qubit connectivity graph, it synthesizes a possible implementation of the 
  parity matrix that respects the connectivity.
  [(#7394)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7394)

* Two new templates called `qml.labs.resource_estimation.ResourceTrotterVibrational` and 
  `qml.labs.resource_estimation.ResourceTrotterVibronic` have been added to perform resource 
  estimation for trotterization of vibrational and vibronic Hamiltonians, respectively.
  [(#7720)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7720)

* Several new templates for various algorithms required for supporting compact Hamiltonian 
  development and resource estimation have been added: `qml.ResourceOutOfPlaceSquare`, 
  `qml.ResourcePhaseGradient`, `qml.ResourceOutMultiplier`, `qml.ResourceSemiAdder`, `qml.ResourceBasisRotation`, `qml.ResourceSelect`, and 
  `qml.ResourceQROM`.
  [(#7725)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7725)

* A new module called :mod:`qml.labs.zxopt <pennylane.labs.zxopt>` has been added to provide access 
  to the basic optimization passes from [pyzx](https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for PennyLane 
  circuits.
  [(#7471)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7471)
  
    * :func:`basic_optimization <pennylane.labs.zxopt.basic_optimization>` performs peephole 
      optimizations on the circuit and is a useful subroutine for other optimization passes.
    * :func:`full_optimize <pennylane.labs.zxopt.full_optimize>` optimizes 
      [(Clifford + T)](https://pennylane.ai/compilation/clifford-t-gate-set) circuits.

      circuits and follows the pipeline described in the 
      [pyzx docs](https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simplify.html).
    * :func:`todd <pennylane.labs.zxopt.todd>` performs Third Order Duplicate and Destroy 
      (`TODD <https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01557>`__) via phase polynomials and reduces T gate counts.

* New functionality has been added to create and manipulate product formulas in the `trotter_error` 
  module.
  [(#7224)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7224)

  [(#7628)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7628)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* Support for gradient keyword arguments as QNode keyword arguments has been removed. Instead please 
  use the new `gradient_kwargs` keyword argument accordingly.
  [(#7648)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7648)

* The default value of `cache` is now `"auto"` with `qml.execute`. Like `QNode`, `"auto"` only turns 
  on caching when `max_diff > 1`.
  [(#7644)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7644)

* The `return_type` property of `MeasurementProcess` has been removed. Please use `isinstance` for 
  type checking instead.
  [(#7322)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7322)

* The `KerasLayer` class in `qml.qnn.keras` has been removed because Keras 2 is no longer actively 
  maintained. Please consider using a different machine learning framework, like 
  `PyTorch <demos/tutorial_qnn_module_torch>`__ or 
  `JAX <demos/tutorial_How_to_optimize_QML_model_using_JAX_and_Optax>`__.
  [(#7320)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7320)

* The `qml.gradients.hamiltonian_grad` function has been removed because this gradient recipe is no
  longer required with the :doc:`new operator arithmetic system </news/new_opmath>`.
  [(#7302)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7302)

* Accessing terms of a tensor product (e.g., `op = X(0) @ X(1)`) via `op.obs` has been removed.

* `qml.tape.TapeError` has been removed.
  [(#7205)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7205)

<h3>Deprecations 👋</h3>

Here's a list of deprecations made this release. For a more detailed breakdown of deprecations and alternative code to use instead,
please consult the :doc:`deprecations and removals page </development/deprecations>`.

* Python 3.10 support is deprecated and support will be removed in v0.43. Please upgrade to Python 
  3.11 or newer.

* Support for Mac x86 has been removed. This includes Macs running on Intel processors.
  This is because 
  [JAX has also dropped support for it since 0.5.0](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#jax-050-jan-17-2025),
  with the rationale being that such machines are becoming increasingly scarce. If support for Mac x86 
  platforms is still desired, please install Catalyst v0.11.0, PennyLane v0.41.0, PennyLane-Lightning 
  v0.41.0, and JAX v0.4.28.
  
* Top-level access to `DeviceError`, `PennyLaneDeprecationWarning`, `QuantumFunctionError` and `ExperimentalWarning` have been deprecated and will be removed in v0.43. Please import them from the new `exceptions` module.
  [(#7292)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7292)
  [(#7477)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7477)
  [(#7508)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7508)
  [(#7603)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7603)

* `qml.operation.Observable` and the corresponding `Observable.compare` have been deprecated, as
  PennyLane now depends on the more general `Operator` interface instead. The
  `Operator.is_hermitian` property can instead be used to check whether or not it is highly likely
  that the operator instance is Hermitian.
  [(#7316)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7316)

* The boolean functions provided in `qml.operation` are deprecated. See the 
  :doc:`deprecations page </development/deprecations>` for equivalent code to use instead. These 
  include `not_tape`, `has_gen`, `has_grad_method`, `has_multipar`, `has_nopar`, `has_unitary_gen`, 
  `is_measurement`, `defines_diagonalizing_gates`, and `gen_is_multi_term_hamiltonian`.
  [(#7319)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7319)

* `qml.operation.WiresEnum`, `qml.operation.AllWires`, and `qml.operation.AnyWires` are deprecated. 
  To indicate that an operator can act on any number of wires, `Operator.num_wires = None` should be 
  used instead. This is the default and does not need to be overwritten unless the operator 
  developer wants to add wire number validation.
  [(#7313)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7313)

* The :func:`qml.QNode.get_gradient_fn` method is now deprecated. Instead, use 
  :func:`~.workflow.get_best_diff_method` to obtain the differentiation method.
  [(#7323)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7323)

* With program capture enabled, MCM method validation now happens on execution rather than setup.
  [(#7475)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7475)

* A `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file has been added to the PennyLane repository. This file will allow 
  specifying commits that should be ignored in the output of `git blame`. For example, this can be 
  useful when a single commit includes bulk reformatting.
  [(#7507)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7507)

* A `.gitattributes` file has been added to standardize LF as the end-of-line character for the 
  PennyLane repository.
  [(#7502)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7502)

* `DefaultQubit` now implements `preprocess_transforms` and `setup_execution_config` instead of 
  `preprocess`.
  [(#7468)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7468)

* A subset of `pylint` errors have been fixed in the `tests` folder.
  [(#7446)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7446)

* Excessively expensive test cases that do not add value in `tests/templates/test_subroutines/` have 
  been reduced or removed.

  `PyPA binary-distribution format <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/>_` 
  guidelines more closely.
  [(#7382)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7382)

* `null.qubit` can now support an optional `track_resources` argument which allows it to record which gates are executed.
  [(#7226)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7226)
  [(#7372)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7372)
  [(#7392)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7392)
  [(#7813)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7813)

* A new internal module, `qml.concurrency`, is added to support internal use of multiprocess and multithreaded execution of workloads. This also migrates the use of `concurrent.futures` in `default.qubit` to this new design.
  [(#7303)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7303)

* Test suites in `tests/transforms/test_defer_measurement.py` now use analytic mocker devices to 
  test numeric results.
  [(#7329)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7329)

* A new `pennylane.exceptions` module has been added for custom errors and warnings.
  [(#7205)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7205)
  [(#7292)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7292)

* Several `__init__.py` files in `math`, `ops`, `qaoa`, `tape` and `templates` have been cleaned up 
  to be explicit in what they import. 
  [(#7200)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7200)
  
* The `Tracker` class has been moved into the `devices` module.
  [(#7281)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7281)

  supported lightning devices (`lightning.kokkos` and `lightning.gpu`).
  [(#7674)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7674)

* The circuit drawings for `qml.Select` and `qml.SelectPauliRot` have been updated to include two 
  commonly used symbols for Select-applying, or -multiplexing, an operator. 
  [(#7464)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7464)
  
* The entry in the :doc:`/news/program_capture_sharp_bits` page for transforms has been updated; 
  non-native transforms being applied to QNodes wherein operators have dynamic wires can lead to 
  incorrect results.
  [(#7426)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7426)

* Fixed the wrong `theta` to `phi` in :class:`~pennylane.IsingXY`.
  [(#7427)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7427)

* In the :doc:`/introduction/compiling_circuits` page, in the "Decomposition in stages" section,
  circuit drawings now render in a way that's easier to read.
  [(#7419)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7419)

* The entry in the :doc:`/news/program_capture_sharp_bits` page for using program capture with 
  Catalyst has been updated. Instead of using ``qjit(experimental_capture=True)``, Catalyst is now 
  compatible with the global toggles ``qml.capture.enable()`` and ``qml.capture.disable()`` for 
  enabling and disabling program capture.
  [(#7298)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7298)

* The simulation technique table in the :doc:`/introduction/dynamic_quantum_circuits` page has been 
  updated to correct an error regarding analytic mode support for the ``tree-traversal`` method; 
  ``tree-traversal`` supports analytic mode.
  [(#7490)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7490)

* A warning has been added to the documentation for `qml.snapshots` and `qml.Snapshot`, clarifying 
  that compilation transforms may move operations across a `Snapshot`.
  [(#7746)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7746)

* In the :doc:`/development/guide/documentation` page, references to the outdated Sphinx and 
  unsupported Python versions have been updated. This helps ensure contributors follow current 
  standards and avoid compatibility issues.
  [(#7479)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7479)

* The documentation of `qml.pulse.drive` has been updated and corrected.
  [(#7459)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7459)

* The API list in the documentation has been alphabetized to ensure consistent ordering. 
  [(#7792)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7792)

<h3>Bug fixes 🐛</h3>

* Fixes `SelectPauliRot._flatten` and `TemporaryAND._primitve_bind_call`.
  [(#7843)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7843)

* Fixes a bug where normalization in `qml.StatePrep` with `normalize=True` was skipped if
  `validate_norm` is set to `False`.
  [(#7835)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7835) 

* The :func:`~.transforms.cancel_inverses` transform no longer changes the order of operations that 
  don't have shared wires, providing a deterministic output.
  [(#7328)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7328)

* Fixed broken support of `qml.matrix` for a `QNode` when using mixed Torch GPU & CPU data for 
  parametric tensors.
  [(#7775)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7775) 

* Fixed `CircuitGraph.iterate_parametrized_layers`, and thus `metric_tensor`, when the same 
  operation occurs multiple times in the circuit.
  [(#7757)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7757)

* Fixed a bug with transforms that require the classical Jacobian applied to QNodes, where only
  some arguments are trainable and an intermediate transform does not preserve trainability 
  information.
  [(#7345)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7345)

* The `qml.ftqc.ParametricMidMeasureMP` class was unable to accept data from `jax.numpy.array` 
  inputs when specifying the angle, due to the given hashing policy. The implementation was updated 
  to ensure correct hashing behavior for `float`, `numpy.array`, and `jax.numpy.array` inputs.
  [(#7693)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7693)

* A bug in `qml.draw_mpl` for circuits with work wires has been fixed. The previously inconsistent 
  mapping for these wires has been resolved, ensuring accurate assignment during drawing.
  [(#7668)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7668)

* A bug in `ops.op_math.Prod.simplify()` has been fixed that led to global phases being discarded
  in special cases. Concretely, this problem occurs when Pauli factors combine into the identity
  up to a global phase _and_ there is no Pauli representation of the product operator.
  [(#7671)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7671)

* The behaviour of the `qml.FlipSign` operation has been fixed: passing an integer `m` as the wires 
  argument is now interpreted as a single wire (i.e. `wires=[m]`). This is different from the 
  previous interpretation of `wires=range(m)`. 
  Also, the `qml.FlipSign.wires` attribute is now returning the correct `Wires` object as for all other operations in PennyLane.
  [(#7647)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7647)

* `qml.equal` now works with `qml.PauliError`s.
  [(#7618)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7618)

* The `qml.transforms.cancel_inverses` transform can now be used with `jax.jit`.
  [(#7487)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7487)

* `qml.StatePrep` no longer validates the norm of statevectors.
  [(#7615)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7615)

* The `qml.PhaseShift` operation is now working correctly with a batch size of 1.
  [(#7622)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7622)

* `qml.metric_tensor` can now be calculated with Catalyst present.
  [(#7528)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7528)

* The mapping to standard wires (consecutive integers) of `qml.tape.QuantumScript` has been fixed
  to correctly consider work wires that are not used otherwise in the circuit.
  [(#7581)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7581)

* Fixed a bug where certain transforms with a native program capture implementation give incorrect 
  results when dynamic wires were present in the circuit. The affected transforms were:
  * :func:`~.transforms.cancel_inverses`
  * :func:`~.transforms.merge_rotations`
  * :func:`~.transforms.single_qubit_fusion`
  * :func:`~.transforms.merge_amplitude_embedding`
  [(#7426)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7426)

* The `Operator.pow` method has been fixed to raise to the power of 2 the qutrit operators 
  `~.TShift`, `~.TClock`, and `~.TAdd`.
  [(#7505)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7505)

* The queuing behavior of the controlled of a controlled operation has been fixed.
  [(#7532)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7532)

* A new decomposition was implemented for two-qubit `QubitUnitary` operators in 
  `two_qubit_decomposition` based on a type-AI Cartan decomposition. It fixes previously faulty edge 
  cases for unitaries that require 2 or 3 CNOT gates. Now, 3 CNOTs are used for both cases, using 
  one more CNOT than theoretically required in the former case.
  [(#7474)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7474)

* Fixed a bug in `to_openfermion` where identity qubit-to-wires mapping was not obeyed.
  [(#7332)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7332)

* Fixed a bug in the validation of :class:`~.SelectPauliRot` that prevents parameter broadcasting.
  [(#7377)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7377)

* Usage of NumPy in `default.mixed` source code has been converted to `qml.math` to avoid
  unnecessary dependency on NumPy and to fix a bug that caused an error when using `default.mixed` 
  with PyTorch and GPUs.
  [(#7384)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7384)

* With program capture enabled (`qml.capture.enable()`), `QSVT` no longer treats abstract values as 
  metadata.
  [(#7360)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7360)

* A fix was made to `default.qubit` to allow for using `qml.Snapshot` with defer-measurements 
  (`mcm_method="deferred"`).
  [(#7335)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7335)

* Fixed the repr for empty `Prod` and `Sum` instances to better communicate the existence of an 
  empty instance.
  [(#7346)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7346)

* Fixed a bug where circuit execution fails with ``BlockEncode`` initialized with sparse matrices.
  [(#7285)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7285)

* An informative error message has been added if `qml.cond` is used with an abstract condition with
  jitting on `default.qubit` when program capture is enabled.
  [(#7314)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7314)

* Fixed a bug where using a ``StatePrep`` operation with `batch_size=1` did not work with 
  ``default.mixed``.
  [(#7280)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7280)

* Gradient transforms can now be used in conjunction with batch transforms with all interfaces.
  [(#7287)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7287)

* Fixed a bug where the global phase was not being added in the ``QubitUnitary`` decomposition.  
  [(#7244)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7244)
  [(#7270)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7270)

* Using finite differences with program capture without x64 mode enabled now raises a warning.
  [(#7282)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7282)

* When the `mcm_method` is specified to the `"device"`, the `defer_measurements` transform will 
  no longer be applied. Instead, the device will be responsible for all MCM handling.
  [(#7243)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7243)

* Fixed coverage of `qml.liealg.CII` and `qml.liealg.AIII`.
  [(#7291)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7291)

* Fixed a bug where the phase is used as the wire label for a `qml.GlobalPhase` when capture is 
  enabled.
  [(#7211)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7211)

* Fixed a bug that caused `CountsMP.process_counts` to return results in the computational basis, 
  even if an observable was specified.
  [(#7342)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7342)

* Fixed a bug that caused `SamplesMP.process_counts` used with an observable to return a list of 
  eigenvalues for each individual operation in the observable, instead of the overall result.
  [(#7342)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7342)

* Fixed a bug where `two_qubit_decomposition` provides an incorrect decomposition for some special 
  matrices.
  [(#7340)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7340)

* Fixed a bug where the powers of `qml.ISWAP` and `qml.SISWAP` were decomposed incorrectly.
  [(#7361)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7361)

* Returning `MeasurementValue`s from the `ftqc` module's parametric mid-circuit measurements
  (`measure_arbitrary_basis`, `measure_x` and `measure_y`) no longer raises an error in circuits 
  using `diagonalize_mcms`.
  [(#7387)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7387)

* Fixed a bug where the :func:`~.transforms.single_qubit_fusion` transform produces a tape that is
  off from the original tape by a global phase.
  [(#7619)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7619)

* Fixed a bug where an error is raised from the decomposition graph when the resource params of an operator contains lists.
  [(#7722)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7722)

* Fixed a bug with the new `Select` decomposition based on unary iteration. There was an erroneous `print` statement.
  [(#7842)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7842)

* Fixes a bug where an operation wrapped in `partial_wires` does not get queued.
  [(#7830)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/7830)
