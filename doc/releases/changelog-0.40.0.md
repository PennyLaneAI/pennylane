# Release 0.40.0 (current release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h4>Efficient state preparation methods ü¶æ</h4>

* Added new ``MPSPrep`` template to prepare quantum states in tensor simulators.
  [(#6431)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6431)

* Users can prepare a linear combination of basis states using `qml.Superposition`.
  [(#6670)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6670)

  ```python
  coeffs = np.array([0.70710678, 0.70710678])
  basis =  np.array([[0, 0], [1, 0]])

  @qml.qnode(qml.device('default.qubit', wires=2))
  def circuit():
      qml.Superposition(coeffs, basis)
      return qml.state()
  ```
  ```
  >>> circuit()
  tensor([0.70710678+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.70710678+0.j, 0.+0.j], requires_grad=True)
  ```

  This template is also JAX-jit compatible!

<h4>Enhanced QSVT functionality ü§©</h4>

* New functionality to calculate angles for QSP and QSVT has been added. This includes the function `qml.poly_to_angles`
  to obtain angles directly and the function `qml.transform_angles` to convert angles from one subroutine to another.
  [(#6483)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6483)

* The `qml.qsvt` function has been improved to be more user-friendly. Old functionality is moved to `qml.qsvt_legacy`
  and it will be deprecated in release v0.40.
  [(#6520)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6520/)
  [(#6693)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6693)

* New `qml.GQSP` template has been added to perform Generalized Quantum Signal Processing (GQSP).
  The functionality `qml.poly_to_angles` has been also extended to support GQSP.
  [(#6565)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6565)

<h4>Generalized Trotter products üêñ</h4>

* Added a function `qml.trotterize` to generalize the Suzuki-Trotter product to arbitrary quantum functions.
  [(#6627)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6627)

  ```python
  def my_custom_first_order_expansion(time, theta, phi, wires, flip):
    "This is the first order expansion (U_1)."
    qml.RX(time*theta, wires[0])
    qml.RY(time*phi, wires[1])
    if flip:
        qml.CNOT(wires=wires[:2])

  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
  def my_circuit(time, angles, num_trotter_steps):
      TrotterizedQfunc(
          time,
          *angles,
          qfunc=my_custom_first_order_expansion,
          n=num_trotter_steps,
          order=2,
          wires=['a', 'b'],
          flip=True,
      )
      return qml.state()
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> time = 0.1
  >>> angles = (0.12, -3.45)
  >>> print(qml.draw(my_circuit, level=3)(time, angles, num_trotter_steps=1))
  a: ‚îÄ‚îÄRX(0.01)‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ï≠‚óè‚îÄ‚ï≠‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄRX(0.01)‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§  State
  b: ‚îÄ‚îÄRY(-0.17)‚îÄ‚ï∞X‚îÄ‚ï∞X‚îÄ‚îÄRY(-0.17)‚îÄ‚î§  State
  ```

<h4>Bosonic operators üéà</h4>

A new module, :mod:`qml.bose <pennylane.bose>`, has been added to PennyLane that includes support 
for constructing and manipulating Bosonic operators and converting between Bosonic operators and 
qubit operators.

* Bosonic operators analogous to `qml.FermiWord` and `qml.FermiSentence` are now available with 
  :class:`qml.BoseWord <pennylane.BoseWord>` and :class:`qml.BoseSentence <pennylane.BoseSentence>`.
  [(#6518)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6518)

  :class:`qml.BoseWord <pennylane.BoseWord>` and :class:`qml.BoseSentence <pennylane.BoseSentence>` 
  operate similarly to their fermionic counterparts. To create a Bose word, a dictionary 
  is required as input, where the keys are tuples of boson indicies and values are `'+/-'` (denoting 
  the bosonic creation/annihilation operators). For example, the :math:`b^{\dagger}_0 b_1` can be 
  constructed as follows.

  ```pycon
  >>> w = qml.BoseWord({(0, 0) : '+', (1, 1) : '-'})
  >>> print(w)
  b‚Å∫(0) b(1)
  ```

  Multiple Bose words can then be combined to form a Bose sentence:

  ```pycon
  >>> w1 = qml.BoseWord({(0, 0) : '+', (1, 1) : '-'})
  >>> w2 = qml.BoseWord({(0, 1) : '+', (1, 2) : '-'})
  >>> s = qml.BoseSentence({w1 : 1.2, w2: 3.1})
  >>> print(s)
  1.2 * b‚Å∫(0) b(1)
  + 3.1 * b‚Å∫(1) b(2)
  ```

* Functionality for converting bosonic operators to qubit operators is available with 
  :func:`qml.unary_mapping <pennylane.unary_mapping>`, :func:`qml.binary_mapping <pennylane.binary_mapping>`, 
  and :func:`qml.christiansen_mapping <pennylane.christiansen_mapping>`.
  [(#6623)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6623)
  [(#6576)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6576)
  [(#6564)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6564)

  All three mappings follow the same syntax, where a :class:`qml.BoseWord <pennylane.BoseWord>` or 
  :class:`qml.BoseSentence <pennylane.BoseSentence>` is required as input.

  ```python
  >>> w = qml.BoseWord({(0, 0): "+"})
  >>> qml.binary_mapping(w, n_states=4)
  0.6830127018922193 * X(0)
  + -0.1830127018922193 * X(0) @ Z(1)
  + -0.6830127018922193j * Y(0)
  + 0.1830127018922193j * Y(0) @ Z(1)
  + 0.3535533905932738 * X(0) @ X(1)
  + -0.3535533905932738j * X(0) @ Y(1)
  + 0.3535533905932738j * Y(0) @ X(1)
  + (0.3535533905932738+0j) * Y(0) @ Y(1)
  ```

  Additional fine-tuning is available within each function, such as the maximum number of allowed
  bosonic states and a tolerance for discarding imaginary parts of the coefficients.

<h4>Construct vibrational Hamiltonians ü´®</h4>

* Added submodule for calculating vibrational Hamiltonians
  * Implemented helper functions for geometry optimization, harmonic analysis,
    and normal-mode localization.
    [(#6453)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6453)
    [(#6666)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6666)
  * Implemented wrapper function for vibrational Hamiltonian calculation and dataclass
    for storing the data.
    [(#6652)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6652)
  * Implemented functions for generating the vibrational Hamiltonian in VSCF basis
    [(#6688)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6688)

* Added support to build a vibrational Hamiltonian in Taylor form.
  [(#6523)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6523)

<h3>Improvements üõ†</h3>

<h4>QChem improvements</h4>

* The `qml.qchem.factorize` function now supports new methods for double factorization:
  Cholesky decomposition (`cholesky=True`) and compressed double factorization (`compressed=True`).
  [(#6573)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6573)
  [(#6611)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6611)

* A new function for performing the [block-invariant symmetry shift](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13772) 
  on electronic integrals has been added with `qml.qchem.symmetry_shift`.
  [(#6574)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6574)

* The differentiable Hartree-Fock workflow is now compatible with JAX.
  [(#6096)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6096)
  [(#6707)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6707)

<h4>Transform for combining GlobalPhase instances</h4>

* A new transform called `qml.transforms.combine_global_phases` has been added. It combines all 
  `qml.GlobalPhase` gates in a circuit into a single one applied at the end. This can be useful for 
  circuits that include a lot of `qml.GlobalPhase` gates that are introduced directly during 
  circuit creation, decompositions that include `qml.GlobalPhase` gates, etc.
  [(#6686)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6686)

<h4>Better drawing functionality</h4>

* `qml.draw_mpl` now has a `wire_options` keyword argument, which allows for global- and per-wire 
  customization with options like `color`, `linestyle`, and `linewidth`.
  [(#6486)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6486)

  Here is an example that would make all wires cyan and bold except for wires 2 and 6, which are 
  dashed and a different colour.

  ```python
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
  def circuit(x):
      for w in range(5):
          qml.Hadamard(w) 
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliY(1))

  wire_options = {"color": "cyan", 
                  "linewidth": 5, 
                  2: {"linestyle": "--", "color": "red"}, 
                  6: {"linestyle": "--", "color": "orange"}
              }
  print(qml.draw_mpl(circuit, wire_options=wire_options)(0.52))
  ```

<h4>New device capabilities üíæ</h4>

* Two new methods, `setup_execution_config` and `preprocess_transforms`, have been added to the 
  `Device` class. Device developers are encouraged to override these two methods separately instead of the
  `preprocess` method. For now, to avoid ambiguity, a device is allowed to override either these
  two methods or `preprocess`, but not both. In the long term, we will slowly phase out the use of
  `preprocess` in favour of these two methods for better separation of concerns.
  [(#6617)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6617)

* Developers of plugin devices now have the option of providing a TOML-formatted configuration file
  to declare the capabilities of the device. See
  [Device Capabilities](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/latest/development/plugins.html#device-capabilities) 
  for details.

* An internal module called `qml.devices.capabilities` has been added that defines a new 
  `DeviceCapabilites` data class, as well as functions that load and parse the TOML-formatted 
  configuration files.
  [(#6407)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6407)

  ```pycon
  >>> from pennylane.devices.capabilities import DeviceCapabilities
  >>> capabilities = DeviceCapabilities.from_toml_file("my_device.toml")
  >>> isinstance(capabilities, DeviceCapabilities)
  True
  ```

* Devices that extend `qml.devices.Device` now have an optional class attribute called 
  `capabilities`, which is an instance of the `DeviceCapabilities` data class constructed from the 
  configuration file if it exists. Otherwise, it is set to `None`.
  [(#6433)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6433)

  ```python
  from pennylane.devices import Device

  class MyDevice(Device):
      config_filepath = "path/to/config.toml"
      ...
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> isinstance(MyDevice.capabilities, DeviceCapabilities)
  True
  ```

* Default implementations of `Device.setup_execution_config` and `Device.preprocess_transforms`
  have been added to the device API for devices that provide a TOML configuration file and, thus, 
  have a `capabilities` property.
  [(#6632)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6632)
  [(#6653)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6653)

<h4>Capturing and representing hybrid programs</h4>

* Support has been added for `if`/`else` statements and `for` and `while` loops in circuits executed 
  with `qml.capture.enabled`, via Autograph. Autograph conversion is now used by default in 
  `make_plxpr`, but can be skipped with `autograph=False`.
  [(#6406)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6406)
  [(#6413)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6413)
  [(#6426)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6426)
  [(#6645)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6645)
  [(#6685)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6685)

* `qml.transform` now accepts a `plxpr_transform` argument. This argument must be a function that 
  can transform plxpr. Note that executing a transformed function will currently raise a 
  `NotImplementedError`. To see more details, check out the 
  :func:`documentation of qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`.
  [(#6633)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6633)
  [(#6722)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6722)

* Users can now apply transforms with program capture enabled. Transformed functions cannot be
  executed by default. To apply the transforms (and to be able to execute the function), it must be 
  decorated with the new `qml.capture.expand_plxpr_transforms` function, which accepts a callable as 
  input and returns a new function for which all present transforms have been applied.
  [(#6722)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6722)

  ```python
  from functools import partial
  import jax

  qml.capture.enable()
  wire_map = {0: 3, 1: 6, 2: 9}

  @partial(qml.map_wires, wire_map=wire_map)
  def circuit(x, y):
      qml.RX(x, 0)
      qml.CNOT([0, 1])
      qml.CRY(y, [1, 2])
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(2))
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> qml.capture.make_plxpr(circuit)(1.2, 3.4)
  { lambda ; a:f32[] b:f32[]. let
      c:AbstractMeasurement(n_wires=None) = _map_wires_transform_transform[
      args_slice=slice(0, 2, None)
      consts_slice=slice(2, 2, None)
      inner_jaxpr={ lambda ; d:f32[] e:f32[]. let
          _:AbstractOperator() = RX[n_wires=1] d 0
          _:AbstractOperator() = CNOT[n_wires=2] 0 1
          _:AbstractOperator() = CRY[n_wires=2] e 1 2
          f:AbstractOperator() = PauliZ[n_wires=1] 2
          g:AbstractMeasurement(n_wires=None) = expval_obs f
        in (g,) }
      targs_slice=slice(2, None, None)
      tkwargs={'wire_map': {0: 3, 1: 6, 2: 9}, 'queue': False}
      ] a b
    in (c,) }
  >>> transformed_circuit = qml.capture.expand_plxpr_transforms(circuit)
  >>> jax.make_jaxpr(transformed_circuit)(1.2, 3.4)
  { lambda ; a:f32[] b:f32[]. let
      _:AbstractOperator() = RX[n_wires=1] a 3
      _:AbstractOperator() = CNOT[n_wires=2] 3 6
      _:AbstractOperator() = CRY[n_wires=2] b 6 9
      c:AbstractOperator() = PauliZ[n_wires=1] 9
      d:AbstractMeasurement(n_wires=None) = expval_obs c
    in (d,) }
  ```

* The `qml.iterative_qpe` function can now be compactly captured into plxpr.
  [(#6680)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6680)

* Three new plxpr interpreters have been added that allow for functions and plxpr to be natively 
  transformed with the same API as the corresponding existing transforms in PennyLane when program
  capture is enabled:

  * `qml.capture.transforms.CancelInterpreter`:this class cancels operators appearing consecutively 
    that are adjoints of each other following the same API as `qml.transforms.cancel_inverses`.
    [(#6692)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6692)

  * `qml.capture.transforms.DecomposeInterpreter`: this class decomposes pennylane operators 
    following the same API as `qml.transforms.decompose`.
    [(#6691)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6691)

  * `qml.capture.transforms.MapWiresInterpreter`: this class maps wires to new values following the 
    same API as `qml.map_wires`.
    [(#6697)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6697)

* A `qml.tape.plxpr_to_tape` function is now available that converts plxpr to a tape.
  [(#6343)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6343)

* Execution with capture enabled now follows a new execution pipeline and natively passes the
  captured plxpr to the device. Since it no longer falls back to the old pipeline, execution only 
  works with a reduced feature set.
  [(#6655)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6655)
  [(#6596)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6596)

* PennyLane transforms can now be captured as primitives with experimental program capture enabled.
  [(#6633)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6633)

* `jax.vmap` can be captured with `qml.capture.make_plxpr` and is compatible with quantum circuits.
  [(#6349)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6349)
  [(#6422)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6422)
  [(#6668)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6668)

* A `qml.capture.PlxprInterpreter` base class has been added for easy transformation and execution 
  of plxpr.
  [(#6141)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6141)

* A `DefaultQubitInterpreter` class has been added to provide plxpr execution using python based 
  tools, and the `DefaultQubit.eval_jaxpr` method has been implemented.
  [(#6594)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6594)
  [(#6328)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6328)

* An optional method, `eval_jaxpr`, has been added to the device API for native execution of plxpr 
  programs.
  [(#6580)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6580)

* `qml.capture.qnode_call` has been made private and moved to the `workflow` module.
  [(#6620)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6620/)

<h4>Other Improvements</h4>

* `qml.math.grad` and `qml.math.jacobian` have been added to differentiate a function with inputs of 
  any interface in a JAX-like manner.
  [(#6741)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6741)

* `qml.GroverOperator` now has a `work_wires` property.
  [(#6738)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6738)

* The `Wires` object's usage across Pennylane source code has been tidied up for internal 
  consistency.
  [(#6689)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6689)

* `qml.equal` now supports `qml.PauliWord` and `qml.PauliSentence` instances.
  [(#6703)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6703)

* Redundant commutator computations from `qml.lie_closure` have been removed.
  [(#6724)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6724)

* A comprehensive error is now raised when using `qml.fourier.qnode_spectrum` with standard Numpy
  arguments and `interface="auto"`.
  [(#6622)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6622)

* Pauli string representations for the gates `{X, Y, Z, S, T, SX, SWAP, ISWAP, ECR, SISWAP}` have 
  been added, and a shape error in the matrix conversion of `qml.PauliSentence`s with `list` or 
  `array` inputs has been fixed.
  [(#6562)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6562)
  [(#6587)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6587)
  
* `qml.QNode` and `qml.execute` now forbid certain keyword arguments from being passed positionally.
  [(#6610)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6610)

* The string representations for the `qml.S`, `qml.T`, and `qml.SX` have been shortened.
  [(#6542)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6542)

* Internal class functions and dunder methods have been added to allow for multiplying Resources 
  objects in series and in parallel.
  [(#6567)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6567)

* The `diagonalize_measurements` transform no longer raises an error for unknown observables. Instead,
  they are left undiagonalized, with the expectation that observable validation will catch any undiagonalized
  observables that are also unsupported by the device.
  [(#6653)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6653)

* A `qml.wires.Wires` object can now be converted to a JAX array, if all wire labels are supported as 
  JAX array elements.
  [(#6699)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6699)

* PennyLane is compatible with `quimb 1.10.0`.
  [(#6630)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6630)
  [(#6736)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6736)

* Add developer focused `run` function to `qml.workflow` module.
  [(#6657)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6657)

* Standardize supported interfaces to an internal `Enum` object. 
  [(#6643)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6643)

* Moved all interface handling logic to `interface_utils.py` in the `qml.math` module.
  [(#6649)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6649)

* `qml.execute` can now be used with `diff_method="best"`.
  Classical cotransform information is now handled lazily by the workflow. Gradient method
  validation and program setup is now handled inside of `qml.execute`, instead of in `QNode`.
  [(#6716)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6716)

* Added PyTree support for measurements in a circuit. 
  [(#6378)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6378)

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml

  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
  def circuit():
      qml.Hadamard(0)
      qml.CNOT([0,1])
      return {"Probabilities": qml.probs(), "State": qml.state()}
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> circuit()
  {'Probabilities': array([0.5, 0. , 0. , 0.5]), 'State': array([0.70710678+0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.70710678+0.j])}
  ```

* `_cache_transform` transform has been moved to its own file located
  at `qml.workflow._cache_transform.py`.
  [(#6624)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6624)

* `qml.BasisRotation` template is now JIT compatible.
  [(#6019)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6019)

* The Jaxpr primitives for `for_loop`, `while_loop` and `cond` now store slices instead of
  numbers of args.
  [(#6521)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6521)

* Expand `ExecutionConfig.gradient_method` to store `TransformDispatcher` type.
  [(#6455)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6455)

* Fix the string representation of `Resources` instances to match the attribute names.
  [(#6581)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6581)

* Improved documentation for the `dynamic_one_shot` transform, and a warning is raised when a user-applied `dynamic_one_shot` transform is ignored in favour of the existing transform in a device's preprocessing transform program.
  [(#6701)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6701)

* Added `qml.devices.qubit_mixed` module for mixed-state qubit device support. This module introduces an `apply_operation` helper function that features:

  * Two density matrix contraction methods using `einsum` and `tensordot`
  * Optimized handling of special cases including: Diagonal operators, Identity operators, CX (controlled-X), Multi-controlled X gates, Grover operators

<h3>Labs: a place for unified and rapid prototyping of research software üßë‚Äçüî¨</h3>

.. warning:: 
    This module is **experimental**! Breaking changes and removals will happen without warning. Do not use these features for projects that require long-term support.

This new module in PennyLane‚Äîaccessed under the `qml.labs` namespace‚Äîwill house experimental research software üî¨. Features here may be useful
for state-of-the art research, beta testing, or getting a sneak peek into *potential* new features before
they are added to PennyLane.

The experimental nature of this module means features may not integrate well with other 
PennyLane staples like differentiability, JAX, or JIT compatibility. There may also be unexpected
sharp bits üî™ and errors ‚ùå.

<h4>Resource estimation</h4>

* Resource estimation functionality in Labs is focused on being light-weight and flexible. 
The Labs `resource_estimation` module involves modifications to core PennyLane that reduce the
memory requirements and computational time of resource estimation. These include new or modified
base classes and one new function:
  * `Resources` - This class is simplified in `labs`, removing the arguments: `gate_sizes`, `depth`,
  and `shots`. [(#6428)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6428)
  * `ResourceOperator` - Replaces `ResourceOperation`, expanded to include decompositions. [(#6428)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6428)
  * `CompressedResourceOp` - A new class with the minimum information to estimate resources:
  the operator type and the parameters needed to decompose it. [(#6428)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6428)
  * `ResourceOperator` versions of many existing PennyLane operations, like Pauli operators,
  `ResourceHadamard`, and `ResourceCNOT`. [(#6447)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6447)
  [(#6579)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6579)
  [(#6538)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6538)
  [(#6592)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6592).
  * `get_resources()` - The new entry point to efficiently obtain the resources of quantum circuits.
  [(#6500)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6500)

  Using new Resource versions of existing operations and `get_resources`, we can estimate
  resources quickly:
  ```python
  import pennylane.labs.resource_estimation as re
  
  def my_circuit():
      for w in range(2):
          re.ResourceHadamard(w)
      re.ResourceCNOT([0, 1])
      re.ResourceRX(1.23, 0)
      re.ResourceRY(-4.56, 1)
      re.ResourceQFT(wires=[0, 1, 2])
      return qml.expval(re.ResourceHadamard(2))
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> res = re.get_resources(my_circuit)()
  >>> print(res)
  wires: 3
  gates: 202
  gate_types:
  {'Hadamard': 5, 'CNOT': 10, 'T': 187}
  ```

  We can also set custom gate sets for decompositions:

  ````pycon
  >>> gate_set={"Hadamard","CNOT","RZ", "RX", "RY", "SWAP"}
  >>> res = re.get_resources(my_circuit, gate_set=gate_set)()
  >>> print(res)
  wires: 3
  gates: 24
  gate_types:
  {'Hadamard': 5, 'CNOT': 7, 'RX': 1, 'RY': 1, 'SWAP': 1, 'RZ': 9}
  ````

  Alternatively, it is possible to manually substitute associated resources:

  ```pycon
  >>> new_resources = re.substitute(res, "SWAP", re.Resources(2, 3, {"CNOT":3}))
  >>> print(new_resources)
  {'Hadamard': 5, 'CNOT': 10, 'RX': 1, 'RY': 1, 'RZ': 9}
  ```

<h4>Experimental functionality for handling dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs)</h4>

* Use the `pennylane.labs.dla` module to perform the
  [KAK decomposition](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_kak_decomposition):
  * `cartan_decomp`: obtain a **Cartan decomposition** of an input **Lie algebra** via an **involution**.
  [(#6392)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6392)
  * We provide a variety of **involutions** like `concurrence_involution`, `even_odd_involution` and canonical Cartan involutions.
  [(#6392)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6392)
  [(#6396)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6396)
  * `cartan_subalgebra`: compute a horizontal **Cartan subalgebra**.
  [(#6403)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6403)
  * ``variational_kak_adj``: compute a [variational KAK decomposition](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_fixed_depth_hamiltonian_simulation_via_cartan_decomposition) of a Hermitian operator using a **Cartan decomposition** and the adjoint
  representation of a horizontal **Cartan subalgebra**.
  [(#6446)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6446)

  To use this functionality we start with a set of Hermitian operators.

  ```pycon
  >>> n = 3
  >>> gens = [qml.X(i) @ qml.X(i + 1) for i in range(n - 1)]
  >>> gens += [qml.Z(i) for i in range(n)]
  >>> H = qml.sum(*gens)
  ```

  We then generate its Lie algebra by computing the Lie closure.

  ```pycon
  >>> g = qml.lie_closure(gens)
  >>> g = [op.pauli_rep for op in g]
  >>> print(g)
  [1 * X(0) @ X(1), 1 * X(1) @ X(2), 1.0 * Z(0), ...]
  ```

  We then choose an involution (e.g. `concurrence_involution`) that defines a Cartan decomposition `g = k + m`. `k` is the vertical subalgebra, and `m` its horizontal complement (not a subalgebra).

  ```pycon
  >>> from pennylane.labs.dla import concurrence_involution, cartan_decomp
  >>> involution = concurrence_involution
  >>> k, m = cartan_decomp(g, involution=involution)
  ```

  The next step is just re-ordering the basis elements in `g` and computing its `structure_constants`.

  ```pycon
  >>> g = k + m
  >>> adj = qml.structure_constants(g)
  ```

  We can then compute a (horizontal) Cartan subalgebra `a`, that is, a maximal Abelian subalgebra of `m`.
  ```pycon
  >>> from pennylane.labs.dla import cartan_subalgebra
  >>> g, k, mtilde, a, adj = cartan_subalgebra(g, k, m, adj)
  ```

  Having determined both subalgebras `k` and `a`, we can compute the KAK decomposition variationally like in [2104.00728](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00728), see our [demo on KAK decomposition in practice](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_fixed_depth_hamiltonian_simulation_via_cartan_decomposition).

  ```pycon
  >>> from pennylane.labs.dla import variational_kak_adj
  >>> dims = (len(k), len(mtilde), len(a))
  >>> adjvec_a, theta_opt = variational_kak_adj(H, g, dims, adj, opt_kwargs={"n_epochs": 3000})
  ```

* We also provide some additional functionality that are useful for handling dynamical Lie algebras.
  * `recursive_cartan_decomp`: perform consecutive recursive Cartan decompositions.
  [(#6396)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6396)
  * `lie_closure_dense`: extension of `qml.lie_closure` using dense matrices.
  [(#6371)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6371)
  [(#6695)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6695)
  * `structure_constants_dense`: extension of `qml.structure_constants` using dense matrices.
  [(#6396)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6396) [(#6376)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6376)


<h4>Vibrational Hamiltonians</h4>

* Implemented helper functions for calculating one-mode PES, two-mode PES, and
three-mode PES.
  [(#6616)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6616)
  [(#6676)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6676)

* Added support to build a vibrational Hamiltonian in the Christiansen form.
  [(#6560)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6560)

<h3>Breaking changes üíî</h3>

* The default graph coloring method of `qml.dot`, `qml.sum`, and `qml.pauli.optimize_measurements` 
  for grouping observables was changed from `"rlf"` to `"lf"`. Internally, 
  `qml.pauli.group_observables` has been replaced with `qml.pauli.compute_partition_indices` in 
  several places to improve efficiency.
  [(#6706)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6706)

* `qml.fourier.qnode_spectrum` no longer automatically converts pure Numpy parameters to the
  Autograd framework. As the function uses automatic differentiation for validation, parameters
  from such a framework have to be used.
  [(#6622)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6622)

* `qml.math.jax_argnums_to_tape_trainable` has been moved and made private to avoid an unecessary 
  QNode dependency in the `qml.math` module.
  [(#6609)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6609)

* Gradient transforms are now applied after the user's transform program. This ensures user 
  transforms work as expected on initial structures (e.g., embeddings or entangling layers), 
  guarantees that gradient transforms only process compatible operations, aligns transform order 
  with user expectations, and avoids confusion.
  [(#6590)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6590)

* Legacy operator arithmetic has been removed. This includes `qml.ops.Hamiltonian`, 
  `qml.operation.Tensor`, `qml.operation.enable_new_opmath`, `qml.operation.disable_new_opmath`, and 
  `qml.operation.convert_to_legacy_H`. Note that `qml.Hamiltonian` will continue to dispatch to 
  `qml.ops.LinearCombination`. For more information, check out the 
  [updated operator troubleshooting page](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/news/new_opmath.html).
  [(#6548)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6548)
  [(#6602)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6602)
  [(#6589)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6589)

* The developer-facing `qml.utils` module has been removed. 
  [(#6588)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6588):

  Specifically, the following 4 sets of functions have been either moved or removed:
    * `qml.utils._flatten`, `qml.utils.unflatten` has been moved and renamed to `qml.optimize.qng._flatten_np` and `qml.optimize.qng._unflatten_np` respectively.
    * `qml.utils._inv_dict` and `qml._get_default_args` have been removed.
    * `qml.utils.pauli_eigs` has been moved to `qml.pauli.utils`.
    * `qml.utils.expand_vector` has been moved to `qml.math.expand_vector`.

* The `qml.qinfo` module has been removed. Please use the corresponding functions in the `qml.math` 
  and `qml.measurements` modules instead.
  [(#6584)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6584)

* Top level access to `Device`, `QubitDevice`, and `QutritDevice` have been removed. Instead, they
  are available as `qml.devices.LegacyDevice`, `qml.devices.QubitDevice`, and 
  `qml.devices.QutritDevice`, respectively.
  [(#6537)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6537)

* The `'ancilla'` argument for `qml.iterative_qpe` has been removed. Instead, use the `'aux_wire'` 
  argument.
  [(#6532)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6532)

* The `qml.BasisStatePreparation` template has been removed. Instead, use `qml.BasisState`.
  [(#6528)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6528)

* The `qml.workflow.set_shots` helper function has been removed. We no longer interact with the 
  legacy device interface in our code. Instead, shots should be specified on the tape, and the 
  device should use these shots.
  [(#6534)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6534)

* `QNode.gradient_fn` has been removed. Please use `QNode.diff_method` instead. 
  `QNode.get_gradient_fn` can also be used to process the differentiation method.
  [(#6535)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6535)

* The `qml.QubitStateVector` template has been removed. Instead, use `qml.StatePrep`.
  [(#6525)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6525)

* `qml.broadcast` has been removed. Users should use `for` loops instead.
  [(#6527)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6527)

* The `max_expansion` argument for `qml.transforms.clifford_t_decomposition` has been removed.
  [(#6571)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6571)

* The `expand_depth` argument for `qml.compile` has been removed.
  [(#6531)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6531)

* The `qml.shadows.shadow_expval` transform has been removed. Instead, please use the
  `qml.shadow_expval` measurement process.
  [(#6530)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6530)
  [(#6561)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6561)

  [(#6577)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6577)

* The `QNode.get_best_method` and `QNode.best_method_str` methods have been deprecated. Instead, use 
  the `qml.workflow.get_best_diff_method` function.
  [(#6418)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6418)

* The `qml.execute` `gradient_fn` keyword argument has been renamed to `diff_method` to better 
  align with the termionology used by the QNode. `gradient_fn` will be removed in v0.41.
  [(#6549)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6549)

<h3>Documentation üìù</h3>

* The docstrings for `qml.qchem.Molecule` and `qml.qchem.molecular_hamiltonian` have been updated to 
  include a note that says that they are not compatible with `qjit` or `jit`.  
  [(#6702)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6702)

  [(#6720)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6720)

* The `qml.Hermitian` class no longer checks that the provided matrix is hermitian. The reason for
  this removal is to allow for faster execution and avoid incompatibilities with `jax.jit`.
  [(#6642)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6642)

* Subclasses of `qml.ops.Controlled` no longer bind the primitives of their base operators when 
  program capture is enabled.
  [(#6672)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6672)

* The `qml.HilbertSchmidt` and `qml.LocalHilbertSchmidt` templates now apply the complex conjugate
  of the unitaries instead of the adjoint, providing the correct result.
  [(#6604)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6604)

* QNode return behaviour is now consistent for lists and tuples.
  [(#6568)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6568)

* QNode now accepts arguments with types defined in libraries that are not necessarily in the list 
  of supported interfaces, such as the `Graph` class defined in `networkx`.
  [(#6600)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6600)

* `qml.math.get_deep_interface` now works properly for Autograd arrays.
  [(#6557)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/6557)
