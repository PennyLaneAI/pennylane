# Release 0.34.0

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h4>Statistics and drawing for mid-circuit measurements 🎨</h4>

* It is now possible to return statistics of composite mid-circuit measurements.
  [(#4888)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4888)

  Mid-circuit measurement results can be composed using basic arithmetic operations and then
  statistics can be calculated by putting the result within a PennyLane
  [measurement](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/measurements.html) like
  `qml.expval()`. For example:

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(phi, theta):
      qml.RX(phi, wires=0)
      m0 = qml.measure(wires=0)
      qml.RY(theta, wires=1)
      m1 = qml.measure(wires=1)
      return qml.expval(~m0 + m1)

  print(circuit(1.23, 4.56))
  ```
  ```
  1.2430187928114291
  ```

  Another option, for ease-of-use when using `qml.sample()`, `qml.probs()`, or `qml.counts()`, is to
  provide a simple list of mid-circuit measurement results:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(phi, theta):
      qml.RX(phi, wires=0)
      m0 = qml.measure(wires=0)
      qml.RY(theta, wires=1)
      m1 = qml.measure(wires=1)
      return qml.sample(op=[m0, m1])

  print(circuit(1.23, 4.56, shots=5))
  ```

  ```
  [[0 1]
   [0 1]
   [0 0]
   [1 0]
   [0 1]]
  ```

  Composite mid-circuit measurement statistics are supported on `default.qubit` and `default.mixed`.
  To learn more about which measurements and arithmetic operators are supported,
  [refer to the measurements page](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/measurements.html) and the
  [documentation for qml.measure](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.measure.html).

* Mid-circuit measurements can now be visualized with the text-based `qml.draw()` and the 
  graphical `qml.draw_mpl()` methods.

  [(#4930)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4930)
  [(#4957)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4957)

  Drawing of mid-circuit measurement capabilities including qubit reuse and reset,
  postselection, conditioning, and collecting statistics is now supported. Here 
  is an all-encompassing example:

  ```python
  def circuit():
      m0 = qml.measure(0, reset=True)
      m1 = qml.measure(1, postselect=1)
      qml.cond(m0 - m1 == 0, qml.S)(0)
      m2 = qml.measure(1)
      qml.cond(m0 + m1 == 2, qml.T)(0)
      qml.cond(m2, qml.PauliX)(1)
  ```
  
  The text-based drawer outputs:

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())
  0: ──┤↗│  │0⟩────────S───────T────┤  
  1: ───║────────┤↗₁├──║──┤↗├──║──X─┤  
        ╚═════════║════╬═══║═══╣  ║    
                  ╚════╩═══║═══╝  ║    
                           ╚══════╝    
  ```
  
  The graphical drawer outputs:

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw_mpl(circuit)())
  ```

<h4>Catalyst is seamlessly integrated with PennyLane ⚗️</h4>

* Catalyst, our next-generation compilation framework, is now accessible within PennyLane,
  allowing you to more easily benefit from hybrid just-in-time (JIT) compilation.

  To access these features, simply install `pennylane-catalyst`:

  ```
  pip install pennylane-catalyst
  ```

  The [qml.compiler](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/latest/code/qml_compiler.html) 
  module provides support for hybrid quantum-classical compilation. 
  [(#4692)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4692)
  [(#4979)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4979)

  Through the use of the `qml.qjit` decorator, entire workflows can be JIT
  compiled — including both quantum and classical processing — down to a machine binary on
  first-function execution. Subsequent calls to the compiled function will execute
  the previously-compiled binary, resulting in significant performance improvements.

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml

  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)

  @qml.qjit
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(theta):
      qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
      qml.RX(theta, wires=1)
      qml.CNOT(wires=[0,1])
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=1))
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(0.5)  # the first call, compilation occurs here
  array(0.)
  >>> circuit(0.5)  # the precompiled quantum function is called
  array(0.)
  ```

  Currently, PennyLane supports the [Catalyst hybrid compiler](https://github.com/pennylaneai/catalyst)
  with the `qml.qjit` decorator. A significant benefit of Catalyst
  is the ability to preserve complex control flow around quantum operations — such as
  `if` statements and `for` loops, and including measurement feedback — during compilation,
  while continuing to support end-to-end autodifferentiation. 

* The following functions can now be used with the `qml.qjit` decorator: `qml.grad`, 
  `qml.jacobian`, `qml.vjp`, `qml.jvp`, and `qml.adjoint`.
  [(#4709)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4709)
  [(#4724)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4724)
  [(#4725)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4725)
  [(#4726)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4726)

  When `qml.grad` or `qml.jacobian` are used with `@qml.qjit`, they are patched to
  [catalyst.grad](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/stable/code/api/catalyst.grad.html) and
  [catalyst.jacobian](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/stable/code/api/catalyst.jacobian.html), 
  respectively.

  ``` python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

  @qml.qjit
  def workflow(x):

      @qml.qnode(dev)
      def circuit(x):
          qml.RX(np.pi * x[0], wires=0)
          qml.RY(x[1], wires=0)
          return qml.probs()

      g = qml.jacobian(circuit)

      return g(x)
  ```

  ``` pycon
  >>> workflow(np.array([2.0, 1.0]))
  array([[ 3.48786850e-16, -4.20735492e-01],
         [-8.71967125e-17,  4.20735492e-01]])
  ```

* JIT-compatible functionality for control flow has been added via `qml.for_loop`,
  `qml.while_loop`, and `qml.cond`.
  [(#4698)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4698)
  [(#5006)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5006)

  `qml.for_loop` and `qml.while_loop` can be deployed as decorators on functions that are the 
  body of the loop. The arguments to both follow typical conventions: 

  ```
  @qml.for_loop(lower_bound, upper_bound, step)
  ```

  ```
  @qml.while_loop(cond_function)
  ```

  Here is a concrete example with `qml.for_loop`:

  ```

  ```

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(n: int, x: float):

      @qml.for_loop(0, n, 1)
      def loop_rx(i, x):
          # perform some work and update (some of) the arguments
          qml.RX(x, wires=0)

          # update the value of x for the next iteration
          return jnp.sin(x)

      # apply the for loop
      final_x = loop_rx(x)

      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0)), final_x
  ```

  ``` pycon
  >>> circuit(7, 1.6)
  (array(0.97926626), array(0.55395718))
  ```

<h4>Decompose circuits into the Clifford+T gateset 🧩</h4>

* The new `qml.clifford_t_decomposition()` transform provides an approximate breakdown 
  of an input circuit into the [Clifford+T gateset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_gates).
  Behind the scenes, this decomposition is enacted via the `sk_decomposition()` 
  function using the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm.
  [(#4801)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4801)
  [(#4802)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4802)

  The Solovay-Kitaev algorithm *approximately* decomposes a quantum circuit into the Clifford+T
  gateset. To account for this, a desired total circuit decomposition error, `epsilon`, must be 
  specified when using `qml.clifford_t_decomposition`:

  ``` python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():
      qml.RX(1.1, 0)
      return qml.state()

  circuit = qml.clifford_t_decomposition(circuit, epsilon=0.1)
  ```
  
  ``` pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())
  0: ──T†──H──T†──H──T──H──T──H──T──H──T──H──T†──H──T†──T†──H──T†──H──T──H──T──H──T──H──T──H──T†──H

  ───T†──H──T──H──GlobalPhase(0.39)─┤
  ```

  The resource requirements of this circuit can also be evaluated:

  ```pycon
  >>> with qml.Tracker(dev) as tracker:
  ...     circuit()
  >>> resources_lst = tracker.history["resources"]
  >>> resources_lst[0]
  wires: 1
  gates: 34
  depth: 34
  shots: Shots(total=None)
  gate_types:
  {'Adjoint(T)': 8, 'Hadamard': 16, 'T': 9, 'GlobalPhase': 1}
  gate_sizes:
  {1: 33, 0: 1}
  ```

<h4>Use an iterative approach for quantum phase estimation 🔄</h4>

* [Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0610214.pdf)
  is now available with `qml.iterative_qpe`.
  [(#4804)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4804)

  The subroutine can be used similarly to mid-circuit measurements:

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", shots=5)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():

    # Initial state
    qml.PauliX(wires=[0])

    # Iterative QPE
    measurements = qml.iterative_qpe(qml.RZ(2., wires=[0]), ancilla=[1], iters=3)

    return [qml.sample(op=meas) for meas in measurements]
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> print(circuit())
  [array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0]), array([0, 1, 1, 1, 1])]
  ```

  The :math:`i`-th element in the list refers to the 5 samples generated by the :math:`i`-th measurement of the algorithm.

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

<h4>Community contributions 🥳</h4>

* The `+=` operand can now be used with a `PauliSentence`, which has also provides
  a performance boost.
  [(#4662)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4662)

* The Approximate Quantum Fourier Transform (AQFT) is now available with `qml.AQFT`.
  [(#4715)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4715)

* `qml.draw` and `qml.draw_mpl` now render operator IDs.
  [(#4749)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4749)

  The ID can be specified as a keyword argument when instantiating an operator:

  ```pycon
  >>> def circuit():
  ...     qml.RX(0.123, id="data", wires=0)
  >>> print(qml.draw(circuit)())
  0: ──RX(0.12,"data")─┤  
  ```

* Non-parametric operators such as `Barrier`, `Snapshot`, and `Wirecut` have been grouped together and moved to `pennylane/ops/meta.py`.
  Additionally, the relevant tests have been organized and placed in a new file, `tests/ops/test_meta.py`.
  [(#4789)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4789)

* The `TRX`, `TRY`, and `TRZ` operators are now differentiable via backpropagation on `default.qutrit`.
  [(#4790)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4790)

* The function `qml.equal` now supports `ControlledSequence` operators.
  [(#4829)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4829)

* XZX decomposition has been added to the list of supported single-qubit unitary decompositions.
  [(#4862)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4862)

* `==` and `!=` operands can now be used with `TransformProgram` and `TransformContainers` instances.
  [(#4858)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4858)

* A `qutrit_mixed` module has been added to `qml.devices` to store helper functions for a future qutrit 
  mixed-state device. A function called `create_initial_state` has been added to this module that creates 
  device-compatible initial states.
  [(#4861)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4861)

* The function `qml.Snapshot` now supports arbitrary state-based measurements (i.e., measurements of type `StateMeasurement`).
  [(#4876)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4908)

* `qml.equal` now supports the comparison of `QuantumScript` and `BasisRotation` objects.
  [(#4902)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4902)
  [(#4919)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4919)

* The function `qml.draw_mpl` now accept a keyword argument `fig` to specify the output figure window.
  [(#4956)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4956)

<h4>Better support for batching</h4>

* `qml.AmplitudeEmbedding` now supports batching when used with Tensorflow.
  [(#4818)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4818)

* `default.qubit` can now evolve already batched states with `qml.pulse.ParametrizedEvolution`.
  [(#4863)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4863)

* `qml.ArbitraryUnitary` now supports batching.
  [(#4745)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4745)

* Operator and tape batch sizes are evaluated lazily, helping run expensive computations less frequently
  and an issue with Tensorflow pre-computing batch sizes.
  [(#4911)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4911)

<h4>Performance improvements and benchmarking</h4>

* Autograd, PyTorch, and JAX can now use vector-Jacobian products (VJPs) provided by the device from the new device API. If a device provides
  a VJP, this can be selected by providing `device_vjp=True` to a QNode or `qml.execute`.

  [(#4557)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4557)
  [(#4654)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4654)
  [(#4878)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4878)
  [(#4841)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4841)

  ```pycon
  >>> dev = qml.device('default.qubit')
  >>> @qml.qnode(dev, diff_method="adjoint", device_vjp=True)
  >>> def circuit(x):
  ...     qml.RX(x, wires=0)
  ...     return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  >>> with dev.tracker:
  ...     g = qml.grad(circuit)(qml.numpy.array(0.1))
  >>> dev.tracker.totals
  {'batches': 1, 'simulations': 1, 'executions': 1, 'vjp_batches': 1, 'vjps': 1}
  >>> g
  -0.09983341664682815
  ```

* `qml.expval` with large `Hamiltonian` objects is now faster and has a significantly lower memory footprint (and constant with respect to the number of `Hamiltonian` terms) when the `Hamiltonian` is a `PauliSentence`. This is due to the introduction of a specialized `dot` method in the `PauliSentence` class which performs `PauliSentence`-`state` products.
  [(#4839)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4839)

* `default.qubit` no longer uses a dense matrix for `MultiControlledX` for more than 8 operation wires.
  [(#4673)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4673)

* Some relevant Pytests have been updated to enable its use as a suite of benchmarks.
  [(#4703)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4703)

* `default.qubit` now applies `GroverOperator` faster by not using its matrix representation but a
  custom rule for `apply_operation`. Also, the matrix representation of `GroverOperator` now runs faster.
  [(#4666)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4666)

* A new pipeline to run benchmarks and plot graphs comparing with a fixed reference has been added. This pipeline will run on a schedule and can be activated on a PR with the label `ci:run_benchmarks`.
  [(#4741)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4741)

* `default.qubit` now supports adjoint differentiation for arbitrary diagonal state-based measurements.
  [(#4865)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4865)

* The benchmarks pipeline has been expanded to export all benchmark data to a single JSON file and a CSV file with runtimes. This includes all references and local benchmarks.
  [(#4873)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4873)

<h4>Final phase of updates to transforms</h4>

* `qml.quantum_monte_carlo` and `qml.simplify` now use the new transform system.
  [(#4708)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4708/)
  [(#4949)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4949)

* The formal requirement that type hinting be provided when using
  the `qml.transform` decorator has been removed. Type hinting can still
  be used, but is now optional. Please use a type checker such as
  [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) if you wish to ensure types are
  being passed correctly.
  [(#4942)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4942/)

<h4>Other improvements</h4>

  [(#4985)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4985)

* `SampleMeasurement` now has an optional method `process_counts` for computing the measurement results from a counts
  dictionary.
  [(#4941)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4941/)

* A new function called `ops.functions.assert_valid` has been added for checking if an `Operator` class is defined correctly.
  [(#4764)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4764)

* `Shots` objects can now be multiplied by scalar values.
  [(#4913)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4913)

* `GlobalPhase` now decomposes to nothing in case devices do not support global phases.
  [(#4855)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4855)

* Custom operations can now provide their matrix directly through the `Operator.matrix()` method
  without needing to update the `has_matrix` property. `has_matrix` will now automatically be
  `True` if `Operator.matrix` is overridden, even if
  `Operator.compute_matrix` is not.
  [(#4844)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4844)

* The logic for re-arranging states before returning them has been improved.
  [(#4817)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4817)

* When multiplying `SparseHamiltonian`s by a scalar value, the result now stays as a
  `SparseHamiltonian`.
  [(#4828)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4828)

* `trainable_params` can now be set upon initialization of a `QuantumScript` instead of having to set the

  [(#4866)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4866)

* The `rot` decomposition now has support for returning a global phase.
  [(#4869)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4869)

* The `"pennylane_sketch"` MPL-drawer style has been added. This is the same as the `"pennylane"`
  style, but with sketch-style lines.
  [(#4880)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4880)

* Operators now define a `pauli_rep` property, an instance of `PauliSentence`, defaulting
  to `None` if the operator has not defined it (or has no definition in the Pauli basis).
  [(#4915)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4915)

* `qml.ShotAdaptiveOptimizer` can now use a multinomial distribution for spreading shots across
  the terms of a Hamiltonian measured in a QNode. Note that this is equivalent to what can be
  done with `qml.ExpvalCost`, but this is the preferred method because `ExpvalCost` is deprecated.
  [(#4896)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4896)

* Decomposition of `qml.PhaseShift` now uses `qml.GlobalPhase` for retaining the global phase information. 
  [(#4657)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4657)
  [(#4947)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4947)

* `qml.equal` for `Controlled` operators no longer returns `False` when equivalent but 
  differently-ordered sets of control wires and control values are compared.
  [(#4944)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4944)

* All PennyLane `Operator` subclasses are automatically tested by `ops.functions.assert_valid` to ensure
  that they follow PennyLane `Operator` standards.
  [(#4922)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4922)

* Probability measurements can now be calculated from a `counts` dictionary with the addition of a 
  `process_counts` method in the `ProbabilityMP` class.
  [(#4952)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4952)

* `ClassicalShadow.entropy` now uses the algorithm outlined in 
  [1106.5458](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5458) to project the approximate density matrix
  (with potentially negative eigenvalues) onto the closest valid density matrix.
  [(#4959)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4959)

* The `ControlledSequence.compute_decomposition` default now decomposes the `Pow` operators, 
  improving compatibility with machine learning interfaces. 
  [(#4995)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4995)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* The function `qml.transforms.classical_jacobian` has been moved to the gradients module
  and is now accessible as `qml.gradients.classical_jacobian`.
  [(#4900)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4900)

* The transforms submodule `qml.transforms.qcut` is now its own module: `qml.qcut`.
  [(#4819)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4819)

* The decomposition of `GroverOperator` now has an additional global phase operation.
  [(#4666)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4666)

* `qml.cond` and the `Conditional` operation have been moved from the `transforms` folder to the `ops/op_math` folder.

  [(#4869)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4869)

* `QuantumScript.graph` is now built using `tape.measurements` instead of `tape.observables`
  because it depended on the now-deprecated `Observable.return_type` property.
  [(#4762)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4762)

* The `"pennylane"` MPL-drawer style now draws straight lines instead of sketch-style lines.
