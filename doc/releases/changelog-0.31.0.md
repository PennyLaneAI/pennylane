  There are a couple of ways to create fermionic operators with this new feature:

  - `qml.FermiC` and `qml.FermiA`: the
    [fermionic creation](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.FermiC.html) and
    [annihilation operators](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.FermiA.html),
    respectively. These operators are 
    defined by passing the index of the orbital that the fermionic operator acts on. For instance, 
    the operators `a⁺(0)` and `a(3)` are respectively constructed as

    ```pycon
    >>> qml.FermiC(0)
    a⁺(0)
    >>> qml.FermiA(3)
    a(3)
    ```

    These operators can be composed with (`*`) and linearly combined with (`+` and `-`) other Fermi operators
    to create arbitrary fermionic Hamiltonians. Multiplying several Fermi operators together creates an operator that we call a Fermi word:

    ```pycon
    >>> word = qml.FermiC(0) * qml.FermiA(0) * qml.FermiC(3) * qml.FermiA(3)
    >>> word 
    a⁺(0) a(0) a⁺(3) a(3)
    ```

    Fermi words can be linearly combined to create a fermionic operator that we call a Fermi sentence:

    ```pycon
    >>> sentence = 1.2 * word - 0.345 * qml.FermiC(3) * qml.FermiA(3)
    >>> sentence
    1.2 * a⁺(0) a(0) a⁺(3) a(3)
    - 0.345 * a⁺(3) a(3)
    ```

  - via [qml.fermi.from_string](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.fermi.from_string.html): create a fermionic operator that represents multiple creation and annihilation operators being 
    multiplied by each other (a Fermi word).

    ```pycon
    >>> qml.fermi.from_string('0+ 1- 0+ 1-')
    a⁺(0) a(1) a⁺(0) a(1)
    >>> qml.fermi.from_string('0^ 1 0^ 1')
    a⁺(0) a(1) a⁺(0) a(1)
    ```

    Fermi words created with `from_string` can also be linearly combined to create a Fermi sentence:

    ```pycon 
    >>> word1 = qml.fermi.from_string('0+ 0- 3+ 3-')
    >>> word2 = qml.fermi.from_string('3+ 3-')
    >>> sentence = 1.2 * word1 - 0.345 * word2
    >>> sentence
    1.2 * a⁺(0) a(0) a⁺(3) a(3)
    - 0.345 * a⁺(3) a(3)
    ```
    
  Additionally, any fermionic operator, be it a single fermionic creation/annihilation operator, a Fermi word, or a Fermi sentence,
  can be mapped to the qubit basis by using [qml.jordan_wigner](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.jordan_wigner.html):

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.jordan_wigner(sentence)
  ((0.1275+0j)*(Identity(wires=[0]))) + ((-0.1275+0j)*(PauliZ(wires=[3]))) + ((-0.3+0j)*(PauliZ(wires=[0]))) + ((0.3+0j)*(PauliZ(wires=[0]) @ PauliZ(wires=[3])))
  ```

<h4>Workflow-level resource estimation 🧮</h4>

* PennyLane's [Tracker](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.Tracker.html) now
  monitors the resource requirements of circuits being executed by the device.
  [(#4045)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4045)
  [(#4110)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4110)

  Suppose we have a workflow that involves executing circuits with different qubit numbers. We
  can obtain the resource requirements as a function of the number of qubits by executing the 
  workflow with the `Tracker` context:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=4)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(n_wires):
      for i in range(n_wires):
          qml.Hadamard(i)
      return qml.probs(range(n_wires))

  with qml.Tracker(dev) as tracker:
      for i in range(1, 5):
          circuit(i)
  ```

  The resource requirements of individual circuits can then be inspected as follows:

  ```pycon
  >>> resources = tracker.history["resources"]
  >>> resources[0]
  wires: 1
  gates: 1
  depth: 1
  shots: Shots(total=None)
  gate_types:
  {'Hadamard': 1}
  gate_sizes:
  {1: 1}
  >>> [r.num_wires for r in resources]
  [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```
  
  Moreover, it is possible to predict the resource requirements without evaluating circuits
  using the `null.qubit` device, which follows the standard execution pipeline but returns numeric
  zeros. Consider the following workflow that takes the gradient of a `50`-qubit circuit:

  ```python
  n_wires = 50
  dev = qml.device("null.qubit", wires=n_wires)

  weight_shape = qml.StronglyEntanglingLayers.shape(2, n_wires)
  weights = np.random.random(weight_shape, requires_grad=True)

  @qml.qnode(dev, diff_method="parameter-shift")
  def circuit(weights):
      qml.StronglyEntanglingLayers(weights, wires=range(n_wires))
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

  with qml.Tracker(dev) as tracker:
      qml.grad(circuit)(weights)
  ```

  The tracker can be inspected to extract resource requirements without requiring a 50-qubit circuit
  run:

  ```pycon
  >>> tracker.totals
  {'executions': 451, 'batches': 2, 'batch_len': 451}
  >>> tracker.history["resources"][0]
  wires: 50
  gates: 200
  depth: 77
  shots: Shots(total=None)
  gate_types:
  {'Rot': 100, 'CNOT': 100}
  gate_sizes:
  {1: 100, 2: 100}
  ```

* Custom operations can now be constructed that solely define resource requirements — an explicit
  decomposition or matrix representation is not needed.
  [(#4033)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4033)

  PennyLane is now able to estimate the total resource requirements of circuits that include one
  or more of these operations, allowing you to estimate requirements for high-level algorithms 
  composed of abstract subroutines. 

  These operations can be defined by inheriting from
  [ResourcesOperation](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.resource.ResourcesOperation.html)
  and overriding the `resources()` method to return an appropriate
  [Resources](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.resource.Resources.html)
  object:

  ```python
  class CustomOp(qml.resource.ResourcesOperation):
      def resources(self):
          n = len(self.wires)
          r = qml.resource.Resources(
              num_wires=n,
              num_gates=n ** 2,
              depth=5,
          )
          return r
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> wires = [0, 1, 2]
  >>> c = CustomOp(wires)
  >>> c.resources()
  wires: 3
  gates: 9
  depth: 5
  shots: Shots(total=None)
  gate_types:
  {}
  gate_sizes:
  {}
  ```
  
  A quantum circuit that contains `CustomOp` can be created and inspected using
  [qml.specs](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.specs.html):

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=wires)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circ():
      qml.PauliZ(wires=0)
      CustomOp(wires)
      return qml.state()
  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> specs = qml.specs(circ)()
  >>> specs["resources"].depth
  6
  ```

<h4>Community contributions from UnitaryHack 🤝</h4>

* [ParametrizedHamiltonian](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.pulse.ParametrizedHamiltonian.html)
  now has an improved string representation.
  [(#4176)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4176)

  ```pycon
  >>> def f1(p, t): return p[0] * jnp.sin(p[1] * t)
  >>> def f2(p, t): return p * t
  >>> coeffs = [2., f1, f2]
  >>> observables =  [qml.PauliX(0), qml.PauliY(0), qml.PauliZ(0)]
  >>> qml.dot(coeffs, observables)
    (2.0*(PauliX(wires=[0])))
  + (f1(params_0, t)*(PauliY(wires=[0])))
  + (f2(params_1, t)*(PauliZ(wires=[0])))
  ```

* The quantum information module now supports [trace distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_distance).
  [(#4181)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4181)

  Two cases are enabled for calculating the trace distance:
  
  - A QNode transform via [qml.qinfo.trace_distance](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.qinfo.transforms.trace_distance.html):

    ```python
    dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=2)

    @qml.qnode(dev)
    def circuit(param):
        qml.RY(param, wires=0)
        qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
        return qml.state()
    ```

    ```pycon
    >>> trace_distance_circuit = qml.qinfo.trace_distance(circuit, circuit, wires0=[0], wires1=[0])
    >>> x, y = np.array(0.4), np.array(0.6)
    >>> trace_distance_circuit((x,), (y,))
    0.047862689546603415
    ```

  - Flexible post-processing via [qml.math.trace_distance](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.math.trace_distance.html):

    ```pycon
    >>> rho = np.array([[0.3, 0], [0, 0.7]])
    >>> sigma = np.array([[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]])
    >>> qml.math.trace_distance(rho, sigma)
    0.19999999999999998
    ```

* It is now possible to prepare qutrit basis states with [qml.QutritBasisState](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.QutritBasisState.html).
  [(#4185)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4185)

  ```python
  wires = range(2)
  dev = qml.device("default.qutrit", wires=wires)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def qutrit_circuit():
      qml.QutritBasisState([1, 1], wires=wires)
      qml.TAdd(wires=wires)
      return qml.probs(wires=1)
  ```
  
  ```pycon
  >>> qutrit_circuit()
  array([0., 0., 1.])
  ```

* A new transform called [one_qubit_decomposition](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.transforms.one_qubit_decomposition.html) has been added to provide a unified interface for decompositions
  of a single-qubit unitary matrix into sequences of X, Y, and Z rotations. All
  decompositions simplify the rotations angles to be between `0` and `4` pi.
  [(#4210)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4210)
  [(#4246)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4246)

  ```pycon
  >>> from pennylane.transforms import one_qubit_decomposition
  >>> U = np.array([[-0.28829348-0.78829734j,  0.30364367+0.45085995j],
  ...               [ 0.53396245-0.10177564j,  0.76279558-0.35024096j]])
  >>> one_qubit_decomposition(U, 0, "ZYZ")
  [RZ(tensor(12.32427531, requires_grad=True), wires=[0]),
   RY(tensor(1.14938178, requires_grad=True), wires=[0]),
   RZ(tensor(1.73305815, requires_grad=True), wires=[0])]
  >>> one_qubit_decomposition(U, 0, "XYX", return_global_phase=True)
  [RX(tensor(10.84535137, requires_grad=True), wires=[0]),
   RY(tensor(1.39749741, requires_grad=True), wires=[0]),
   RX(tensor(0.45246584, requires_grad=True), wires=[0]),
   (0.38469215914523336-0.9230449299422961j)*(Identity(wires=[0]))]
  ```

* The `has_unitary_generator` attribute in `qml.ops.qubit.attributes` no longer contains operators
  with non-unitary generators.
  [(#4183)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4183)

* PennyLane Docker builds have been updated to include the latest plugins and interface versions.
  [(#4178)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4178)

<h4>Extended support for differentiating pulses ⚛️</h4>

* The stochastic parameter-shift gradient method can now be used with hardware-compatible Hamiltonians.
  [(#4132)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4132)
  [(#4215)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4215)

  This new feature generalizes the stochastic parameter-shift gradient transform for pulses 
  (`stoch_pulse_grad`) to support Hermitian generating terms beyond just Pauli words in pulse Hamiltonians, 
  which makes it hardware-compatible.

* A new differentiation method called [qml.gradients.pulse_generator](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.gradients.pulse_generator.html) is available, which combines classical processing 
  with the parameter-shift rule for multivariate gates to differentiate pulse programs. Access it in your pulse
  programs by setting `diff_method=qml.gradients.pulse_generator`. 
  [(#4160)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4160) 

* `qml.pulse.ParametrizedEvolution` now uses _batched_ compressed sparse row (`BCSR`) format. 
  This allows for computing Jacobians of the unitary directly even when `dense=False`.
  [(#4126)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4126)

  ```python
  def U(params):
      H = jnp.polyval * qml.PauliZ(0) # time dependent Hamiltonian
      Um = qml.evolve(H, dense=False)(params, t=10.)
      return qml.matrix(Um)
  params = jnp.array([[0.5]], dtype=complex)
  jac = jax.jacobian(U, holomorphic=True)(params)
  ```

<h4>Broadcasting and other tweaks to Torch and Keras layers 🦾</h4>

* The `TorchLayer` and `KerasLayer` integrations with `torch.nn` and `Keras` have been upgraded.
  Consider the following `TorchLayer`:

  ```python
  n_qubits = 2
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=n_qubits)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def qnode(inputs, weights):
      qml.AngleEmbedding(inputs, wires=range(n_qubits))
      qml.BasicEntanglerLayers(weights, wires=range(n_qubits))
      return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=i)) for i in range(n_qubits)]

  n_layers = 6
  weight_shapes = {"weights": (n_layers, n_qubits)}
  qlayer = qml.qnn.TorchLayer(qnode, weight_shapes)
  ```
  
  The following features are now available:

  - Native support for parameter broadcasting.
    [(#4131)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4131)

    ```pycon
    >>> batch_size = 10
    >>> inputs = torch.rand((batch_size, n_qubits))
    >>> qlayer(inputs)
    >>> dev.num_executions == 1
    True
    ```

  - The ability to draw a `TorchLayer` and `KerasLayer` using `qml.draw()` and
    `qml.draw_mpl()`.
    [(#4197)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4197)

    ```pycon
    >>> print(qml.draw(qlayer, show_matrices=False)(inputs))
    0: ─╭AngleEmbedding(M0)─╭BasicEntanglerLayers(M1)─┤  <Z>
    1: ─╰AngleEmbedding(M0)─╰BasicEntanglerLayers(M1)─┤  <Z>
    ```

  - Support for `KerasLayer` model saving and clearer instructions on `TorchLayer` model saving.
    [(#4149)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4149)
    [(#4158)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4158)

    ```pycon
    >>> torch.save(qlayer.state_dict(), "weights.pt")  # Saving
    >>> qlayer.load_state_dict(torch.load("weights.pt"))  # Loading
    >>> qlayer.eval()
    ```
    
    Hybrid models containing `KerasLayer` or `TorchLayer` objects can also be saved and loaded.

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

<h4>A more flexible projector</h4>

* `qml.Projector` now accepts a state vector representation, which enables the creation of projectors
  in any basis.
  [(#4192)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4192)

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(state):
      return qml.expval(qml.Projector(state, wires=[0, 1]))
  zero_state = [0, 0]
  plusplus_state = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1]) / 2
  ```

  ```pycon
  >>> circuit(zero_state)
  tensor(1., requires_grad=True)
  >>> circuit(plusplus_state)
  tensor(0.25, requires_grad=True)
  ```

<h4>Do more with qutrits</h4>

* Three qutrit rotation operators have been added that are analogous to `RX`, `RY`, and `RZ`:

  - `qml.TRX`: an X rotation
  - `qml.TRY`: a Y rotation
  - `qml.TRZ`: a Z rotation

  [(#2845)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2845)
  [(#2846)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2846)
  [(#2847)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2847)
  
* Qutrit devices now support parameter-shift differentiation.
  [(#2845)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2845)

<h4>The qchem module</h4>

* `qchem.molecular_hamiltonian()`, `qchem.qubit_observable()`, `qchem.import_operator()`, and `qchem.dipole_moment()` now return an arithmetic operator if `enable_new_opmath()` is active.
  [(#4138)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4138)

  [(#4094)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4094)

* Jordan-Wigner transforms that cache Pauli gate objects have been accelerated.
  [(#4046)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4046)

* An error is now raised by `qchem.molecular_hamiltonian` when the `dhf` method is used for an 
  open-shell system. This duplicates a similar error in `qchem.Molecule` but makes it clear
  that the `pyscf` backend can be used for open-shell calculations.
  [(#4058)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4058)

* Updated various qubit tapering methods to support operator arithmetic.
  [(#4252)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4252)

  [(#4254)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4254)

* `DefaultQubit2.preprocess` now returns a new `ExecutionConfig` object with decisions for `gradient_method`,
  `use_device_gradient`, and `grad_on_execution`.
  [(#4102)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4102)

* Support for sample-based measurements has been added to the `DefaultQubit2` device.

  [(#4120)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4120)

* Added a `dense` keyword to `ParametrizedEvolution` that allows forcing dense or sparse matrices.
  [(#4079)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4079)
  [(#4095)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4095)
  [(#4285)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4285)

  an execution.
  [(#4018)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4108)

* `qml.devices.ExecutionConfig` no longer has a `shots` property, as it is now on the `QuantumScript`.  
  It now has a `use_device_gradient` property. `ExecutionConfig.grad_on_execution = None` indicates a 
  request for `"best"`, instead of a string.
  [(#4102)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4102)

* The new device interface for Jax has been integrated with `qml.execute`.
  [(#4137)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4137)

* Several Python built-in functions are now properly defined for instances of the `Shots` class.

  - `print`: printing `Shots` instances is now human-readable
  - `str`: converting `Shots` instances to human-readable strings
  - `==`: equating two different `Shots` instances
  - `hash`: obtaining the hash values of `Shots` instances
  
  [(#4081)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4081)
  [(#4082)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4082)

* `qml.devices.ExecutionConfig` no longer has a `shots` property, as it is now on the `QuantumScript`. It now has a `use_device_gradient` property. `ExecutionConfig.grad_on_execution = None` indicates a request for `"best"` instead of a string.
  [(#4102)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4102)

* `QuantumScript.shots` has been integrated with QNodes so that shots are placed on the `QuantumScript`
  during `QNode` construction.
  [(#4110)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4110)

* The `gradients` module has been updated to use the new `Shots` object internally
  [(#4152)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4152)

<h4>Operators</h4>

* `qml.prod` now accepts a single quantum function input for creating new `Prod` operators.
  [(#4011)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4011)

* `DiagonalQubitUnitary` now decomposes into `RZ`, `IsingZZ` and `MultiRZ` gates
  instead of a `QubitUnitary` operation with a dense matrix.
  [(#4035)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4035)

* All objects being queued in an `AnnotatedQueue` are now wrapped so that `AnnotatedQueue` is not 
  dependent on the has of any operators or measurement processes.
  [(#4087)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4087)

* A `dense` keyword to `ParametrizedEvolution` that allows forcing dense or sparse matrices has been added.
  [(#4079)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4079)
  [(#4095)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4095)

* Added a new function `qml.ops.functions.bind_new_parameters` that creates a copy of an operator with new parameters without mutating the original operator.
  [(#4113)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4113)
  [(#4256)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4256)

* `qml.CY` has been moved from `qml.ops.qubit.non_parametric_ops` to `qml.ops.op_math.controlled_ops`
  and now inherits from `qml.ops.op_math.ControlledOp`.
  [(#4116)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4116/)

* `qml.CZ` now inherits from the `ControlledOp` class and supports exponentiation to arbitrary powers with `pow`, which is no longer limited to integers. It also supports `sparse_matrix` and `decomposition` representations.
  [(#4117)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4117)

* The construction of the Pauli representation for the `Sum` class is now faster.
  [(#4142)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4142)

* `qml.drawer.drawable_layers.drawable_layers` and `qml.CircuitGraph` have been updated to not rely on `Operator`
  equality or hash to work correctly.
  [(#4143)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4143)

<h4>Other improvements</h4>

* A transform dispatcher and program have been added.
  [(#4109)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4109)
  [(#4187)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4187)
  
* Reduced density matrix functionality has been added via `qml.math.reduce_dm` and `qml.math.reduce_statevector`.
  Both functions have broadcasting support.
  [(#4173)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4173)

* The following functions in `qml.qinfo` now support parameter broadcasting:

  - `reduced_dm`
  - `purity`
  - `vn_entropy`
  - `mutual_info`
  - `fidelity`
  - `relative_entropy`
  - `trace_distance`

  [(#4234)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4234)

* The following functions in `qml.math` now support parameter broadcasting:

  - `purity`
  - `vn_entropy`
  - `mutual_info`
  - `fidelity`
  - `relative_entropy`
  - `max_entropy`
  - `sqrt_matrix`
  
  [(#4186)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4186)

* `pulse.ParametrizedEvolution` now raises an error if the number of input parameters does not match the number
  of parametrized coefficients in the `ParametrizedHamiltonian` that generates it. An exception is made for
  `HardwareHamiltonian`s which are not checked.
  [(#4216)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4216)

* The default value for the `show_matrices` keyword argument in all drawing methods is now `True`. 
  This allows for quick insights into broadcasted tapes, for example.
  [(#3920)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3920)

* Type variables for `qml.typing.Result` and `qml.typing.ResultBatch` have been added for type hinting the result of an execution.
  [(#4108)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4108)
  
* The Jax-JIT interface now uses symbolic zeros to determine trainable parameters.
  [(4075)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4075)

* A new function called `pauli.pauli_word_prefactor()` that extracts the prefactor for a given Pauli word has been added.
  [(#4164)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4164)

* Variable-length argument lists of functions and methods in some docstrings is now more clear.
  [(#4242)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4242)

* `qml.drawer.drawable_layers.drawable_layers` and `qml.CircuitGraph` have been updated to not rely on `Operator`
  equality or hash to work correctly.
  [(#4143)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4143)

* Drawing mid-circuit measurements connected by classical control signals to conditional operations is now possible.
  [(#4228)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4228)

* The autograd interface now submits all required tapes in a single batch on the backward pass.
  [(#4245)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4245)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* The default value for the `show_matrices` keyword argument in all drawing methods is now `True`. 
  This allows for quick insights into broadcasted tapes, for example.
  [(#3920)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/3920)

* `DiagonalQubitUnitary` now decomposes into `RZ`, `IsingZZ`, and `MultiRZ` gates rather than a `QubitUnitary`.
  [(#4035)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4035)

* Jax trainable parameters are now `Tracer` instead of `JVPTracer`. It is not always the right definition for the JIT 
  interface, but we update them in the custom JVP using symbolic zeros.
  [(4075)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4075)

* The experimental Device interface `qml.devices.experimental.Device` now requires that the `preprocess` method
  also returns an `ExecutionConfig` object. This allows the device to choose what `"best"` means for various
  hyperparameters like `gradient_method` and `grad_on_execution`.
  [(#4007)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4007)
  [(#4102)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4102)

* Gradient transforms with Jax no longer support `argnum`. Use `argnums` instead.
  [(#4076)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4076)

* `qml.collections`, `qml.op_sum`, and `qml.utils.sparse_hamiltonian` have been removed.
  [(#4071)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4071)

* The `pennylane.transforms.qcut` module now uses `(op, id(op))` as nodes in directed multigraphs that are used within
  the circuit cutting workflow instead of `op`. This change removes the dependency of the module on the hash of operators.
  [(#4227)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4227)

* `Operator.data` now returns a `tuple` instead of a `list`.
  [(#4222)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4222)

* The pulse differentiation methods, `pulse_generator` and `stoch_pulse_grad`, now raise an error when they
  are applied to a QNode directly. Instead, use differentiation via a JAX entry point (`jax.grad`, `jax.jacobian`, ...).
  [(#4241)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4241)

<h3>Deprecations 👋</h3>

* `LieAlgebraOptimizer` has been renamed to `RiemannianGradientOptimizer`.
  [(#4153)(https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4153)]

* `Operation.base_name` has been deprecated. Please use `Operation.name` or `type(op).__name__` instead.

* `QuantumScript`'s `name` keyword argument and property have been deprecated.
  This also affects `QuantumTape` and `OperationRecorder`.
  [(#4141)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4141)

* The `qml.grouping` module has been removed. Its functionality has been reorganized in the `qml.pauli` module.

* The public methods of `DefaultQubit` are pending changes to follow the new device API, as used in
  `DefaultQubit2`. Warnings have been added to the docstrings to reflect this.
  [(#4145)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4145)

* `qml.math.reduced_dm` has been deprecated. Please use `qml.math.reduce_dm` or `qml.math.reduce_statevector` instead.
  [(#4173)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4173)

* `qml.math.purity`, `qml.math.vn_entropy`, `qml.math.mutual_info`, `qml.math.fidelity`,
  `qml.math.relative_entropy`, and `qml.math.max_entropy` no longer support state vectors as
  input. Please call `qml.math.dm_from_state_vector` on the input before passing to any of these functions.
  [(#4186)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4186)

* The `do_queue` keyword argument in `qml.operation.Operator` has been deprecated. Instead of
  setting `do_queue=False`, use the `qml.QueuingManager.stop_recording()` context.
  [(#4148)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4148)

* `zyz_decomposition` and `xyx_decomposition` are now deprecated in favour of `one_qubit_decomposition`.
  [(#4230)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4230)

<h3>Documentation 📝</h3>

* The documentation is updated to construct `QuantumTape` upon initialization instead of with queuing.
  [(#4243)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4243)

* The docstring for `qml.ops.op_math.Pow.__new__` is now complete and it has been updated along with
  `qml.ops.op_math.Adjoint.__new__`.
  [(#4231)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4231)

* The docstring for `qml.grad` now states that it should be used with the Autograd interface only.
  [(#4202)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4202)

* The description of `mult` in the `qchem.Molecule` docstring now correctly states the value
  of `mult` that is supported.
  [(#4058)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4058)

<h3>Bug Fixes 🐛</h3>

* Fixed adjoint jacobian results with `grad_on_execution=False` in the JAX-JIT interface.
  [(4217)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4217)

* Fixed the matrix of `SProd` when the coefficient is tensorflow and the target matrix is not `complex128`.
  [(#4249)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4249)
 
* Fixed a bug where `stoch_pulse_grad` would ignore prefactors of rescaled Pauli words in the
  generating terms of a pulse Hamiltonian.
  [(4156)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4156)
  
* Fixed a bug where the wire ordering of the `wires` argument to `qml.density_matrix`
  was not taken into account.
  [(#4072)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4072)

* A patch in `interfaces/autograd.py` that checks for the `strawberryfields.gbs` device has been removed. 
  That device is pinned to PennyLane <= v0.29.0, so that patch is no longer necessary.
  [(#4089)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4089)

* `qml.pauli.are_identical_pauli_words` now treats all identities as equal. Identity terms on Hamiltonians with non-standard
  wire orders are no longer eliminated.
  [(#4161)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4161)

* `qml.pauli_sentence()` is now compatible with empty Hamiltonians `qml.Hamiltonian([], [])`.
  [(#4171)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4171)

* Fixed a bug with Jax where executing multiple tapes with `gradient_fn="device"` would fail.
  [(#4190)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4190)

* A more meaningful error message is raised when broadcasting with adjoint differentiation on `DefaultQubit`.
  [(#4203)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4203)
  
* The `has_unitary_generator` attribute in `qml.ops.qubit.attributes` no longer contains operators with non-unitary generators.
  [(#4183)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4183)

* Fixed a bug where `op = qml.qsvt()` was incorrect up to a global phase when using `convention="Wx""` and `qml.matrix(op)`.
  [(#4214)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4214)

* Fixed a buggy calculation of the angle in `xyx_decomposition` that causes it to give an incorrect decomposition.
  An `if` conditional was intended to prevent divide by zero errors, but the division was by the sine of the argument. So, any multiple of $\pi$ should trigger the conditional, but it was only checking if the argument was 0. Example: `qml.Rot(2.3, 2.3, 2.3)`
  [(#4210)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4210)

* `Sum` observables can now have trainable parameters.
