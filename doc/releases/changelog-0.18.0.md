# Release 0.18.0 (current release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h4>PennyLane now comes packaged with <code>lightning.qubit</code></h4>

* The C++-based [lightning.qubit](https://pennylane-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) device
  is now included with installations of PennyLane.
  [(#1663)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1663)

  The `lightning.qubit` device is a fast state-vector simulator equipped with the efficient
  [adjoint method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02823) for differentiating quantum circuits,
  check out the plugin
  [release notes](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/blob/v0.18.0/.github/CHANGELOG.md#new-features-since-last-release) for more details! The device can be accessed in the following way:

  ```python
  import pennylane as qml

  wires = 3
  layers = 2
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=wires)

  @qml.qnode(dev, diff_method="adjoint")
  def circuit(weights):
      qml.templates.StronglyEntanglingLayers(weights, wires=range(wires))
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

  weights = qml.init.strong_ent_layers_normal(layers, wires, seed=1967)
  ```

  Evaluating circuits and their gradients on the device can be achieved using the standard approach:

  ```pycon
  >>> print(f"Circuit evaluated: {circuit(weights)}")
  Circuit evaluated: 0.9801286266677633
  >>> print(f"Circuit gradient:\n{qml.grad(circuit)(weights)}")
  Circuit gradient:
  [[[-9.35301749e-17 -1.63051504e-01 -4.14810501e-04]
    [-7.88816484e-17 -1.50136528e-04 -1.77922957e-04]
    [-5.20670796e-17 -3.92874550e-02  8.14523075e-05]]

   [[-1.14472273e-04  3.85963953e-02 -9.39190132e-18]
    [-5.76791765e-05 -9.78478343e-02  0.00000000e+00]
    [ 0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00]]]
  ```

  The adjoint method operates after a forward pass by iteratively applying
  inverse gates to scan backwards through the circuit. The method is already
  available in PennyLane's `default.qubit` device, but the version provided by
  `lightning.qubit` integrates with the C++ backend and is more performant, as
  shown in the plot below:

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/master/doc/_static/lightning_adjoint.png" width=70%/>

<h4>Support for native backpropagation using PyTorch</h4>

* The built-in PennyLane simulator `default.qubit` now supports
  backpropogation with PyTorch.
  [(#1360)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1360)
  [(#1598)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1598)

  As a result, `default.qubit` can now use end-to-end classical backpropagation as
  a means to compute gradients. End-to-end backpropagation can be faster than
  the parameter-shift rule for computing quantum gradients when the number of
  parameters to be optimized is large. This is now the default differentiation method when
  using `default.qubit` with PyTorch.

  Using this method, the created QNode is a 'white-box' that is
  tightly integrated with your PyTorch computation, including
  TorchScript and GPU support.

  ```python
  x = torch.tensor(0.43316321, dtype=torch.float64, requires_grad=True)
  y = torch.tensor(0.2162158, dtype=torch.float64, requires_grad=True)
  z = torch.tensor(0.75110998, dtype=torch.float64, requires_grad=True)

  p = torch.tensor([x, y, z], requires_grad=True)
  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=1)

  @qml.qnode(dev, interface="torch", diff_method="backprop")
  def circuit(x):
      qml.Rot(x[0], x[1], x[2], wires=0)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

  res = circuit(p)
  res.backward()
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> res = circuit(p)
  >>> res.backward()
  >>> print(p.grad)
  tensor([-9.1798e-17, -2.1454e-01, -1.0511e-16], dtype=torch.float64)
  ```

<h4>Improved quantum optimization methods</h4>

* The `RotosolveOptimizer` now can tackle general parametrized circuits, and is no longer
  restricted to single-qubit Pauli rotations.
  [(#1489)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1489)

  This includes:

  - layers of gates controlled by the same parameter,
  - controlled variants of parametrized gates, and
  - Hamiltonian time evolution.

  Note that the eigenvalue spectrum of the gate generator needs to be known to
  use `RotosolveOptimizer` for a general gate, and it
  is required to produce equidistant frequencies.
  For details see [Vidal and Theis, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06323)
  and [Wierichs, Izaac, Wang, Lin 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12390).

  Consider a circuit with a mixture of Pauli rotation gates, controlled Pauli rotations, and
  single-parameter layers of Pauli rotations:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=3, shots=None)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def cost_function(rot_param, layer_par, crot_param):
      for i, par in enumerate(rot_param):
          qml.RX(par, wires=i)
      for w in dev.wires:
          qml.RX(layer_par, wires=w)
      for i, par in enumerate(crot_param):
          qml.CRY(par, wires=[i, (i+1) % 3])

      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1) @ qml.PauliZ(2))
  ```

  This cost function has one frequency for each of the first `RX` rotation angles,
  three frequencies for the layer of `RX` gates that depend on `layer_par`, and two
  frequencies for each of the `CRY` gate parameters. Rotosolve can then be used to minimize
  the `cost_function`:

  ```python
  # Initial parameters
  init_param = [
      np.array([0.3, 0.2, 0.67], requires_grad=True),
      np.array(1.1, requires_grad=True),
      np.array([-0.2, 0.1, -2.5], requires_grad=True),
  ]
  # Numbers of frequencies per parameter
  num_freqs = [[1, 1, 1], 3, [2, 2, 2]]

  opt = qml.RotosolveOptimizer()
  param = init_param.copy()
  ```

  In addition, the optimization technique for the Rotosolve substeps can be chosen via the
  `optimizer` and `optimizer_kwargs` keyword arguments and the minimized cost of the
  intermediate univariate reconstructions can be read out via `full_output`, including the
  cost _after_ the full Rotosolve step:

  ```python
  for step in range(3):
      param, cost, sub_cost = opt.step_and_cost(
          cost_function,
          *param,
          num_freqs=num_freqs,
          full_output=True,
          optimizer="brute",
      )
      print(f"Cost before step: {cost}")
      print(f"Minimization substeps: {np.round(sub_cost, 6)}")
  ```
  ``` pycon
  Cost before step: 0.042008210392535605
  Minimization substeps: [-0.230905 -0.863336 -0.980072 -0.980072 -1.       -1.       -1.      ]
  Cost before step: -0.999999999068121
  Minimization substeps: [-1. -1. -1. -1. -1. -1. -1.]
  Cost before step: -1.0
  Minimization substeps: [-1. -1. -1. -1. -1. -1. -1.]
  ```

  For usage details please consider the [docstring of the optimizer](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.RotosolveOptimizer.html?highlight=rotosolveoptimizer#pennylane.RotosolveOptimizer).

<h4>Faster, trainable, Hamiltonian simulations</h4>

* Hamiltonians are now trainable with respect to their coefficients.
  [(#1483)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1483)

  ``` python
  from pennylane import numpy as np

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)
  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit(coeffs, param):
      qml.RX(param, wires=0)
      qml.RY(param, wires=0)
      return qml.expval(
          qml.Hamiltonian(coeffs, [qml.PauliX(0), qml.PauliZ(0)], simplify=True)
      )

  coeffs = np.array([-0.05, 0.17])
  param = np.array(1.7)
  grad_fn = qml.grad(circuit)
  ```
  ``` pycon
  >>> grad_fn(coeffs, param)
  (array([-0.12777055,  0.0166009 ]), array(0.0917819))
  ```

  Furthermore, a gradient recipe for Hamiltonian coefficients has been added. This makes it possible
  to compute parameter-shift gradients of these coefficients on devices that natively
  support Hamiltonians.
  [(#1551)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1551)

* Hamiltonians are now natively supported on the `default.qubit` device if `shots=None`.
  This makes VQE workflows a lot faster in some cases.
  [(#1551)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1551)
  [(#1596)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1596)

  <img src="https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/hamiltonian_expval_h_plot.png" width=45%/>

* The Hamiltonian can now store grouping information, which can be accessed by a device to
  speed up computations of the expectation value of a Hamiltonian.
  [(#1515)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1515)

  ```python
  obs = [qml.PauliX(0), qml.PauliX(1), qml.PauliZ(0)]
  coeffs = np.array([1., 2., 3.])
  H = qml.Hamiltonian(coeffs, obs, grouping_type='qwc')
  ```

  Initialization with a ``grouping_type`` other than ``None`` stores the indices
  required to make groups of commuting observables and their coefficients.

  ``` pycon
  >>> H.grouping_indices
  [[0, 1], [2]]
  ```

<h4>Create multi-circuit quantum transforms and custom gradient rules</h4>

* Custom gradient transforms can now be created using the new
  `@qml.gradients.gradient_transform` decorator on a batch-tape transform.
  [(#1589)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1589)

  Quantum gradient transforms are a specific case of `qml.batch_transform`.

  Supported gradient transforms must be of the following form:

  ```python
  @qml.gradients.gradient_transform
  def my_custom_gradient(tape, argnum=None, **kwargs):
      ...
      return gradient_tapes, processing_fn
  ```

  Various built-in quantum gradient transforms are provided within the
  `qml.gradients` module, including `qml.gradients.param_shift`.
  Once defined, quantum gradient transforms can be applied directly
  to QNodes:

  ```pycon
  >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
  ... def circuit(x):
  ...     qml.RX(x, wires=0)
  ...     qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
  ...     return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  >>> circuit(0.3)
  tensor(0.95533649, requires_grad=True)
  >>> qml.gradients.param_shift(circuit)(0.5)
  array([[-0.47942554]])
  ```

  Quantum gradient transforms are fully differentiable, allowing higher order derivatives to be
  accessed:

  ```pycon
  >>> qml.grad(qml.gradients.param_shift(circuit))(0.5)
  tensor(-0.87758256, requires_grad=True)
  ```

  Refer to the page of [quantum gradient transforms](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/qml_gradients.html)
  for more details.

* The ability to define *batch* transforms has been added via the new
  `@qml.batch_transform` decorator.
  [(#1493)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1493)

  A batch transform is a transform that takes a single tape or QNode as input,
  and executes multiple tapes or QNodes independently. The results may then be post-processed
  before being returned.

  For example, consider the following batch transform:

  ```python
  @qml.batch_transform
  def my_transform(tape, a, b):
      """Generates two tapes, one with all RX replaced with RY,
      and the other with all RX replaced with RZ."""
      tape1 = qml.tape.JacobianTape()
      tape2 = qml.tape.JacobianTape()

      # loop through all operations on the input tape
      for op in tape.operations + tape.measurements:
          if op.name == "RX":
              with tape1:
                  qml.RY(a * qml.math.abs(op.parameters[0]), wires=op.wires)
              with tape2:
                  qml.RZ(b * qml.math.abs(op.parameters[0]), wires=op.wires)
          else:
              for t in [tape1, tape2]:
                  with t:
                      qml.apply(op)

      def processing_fn(results):
          return qml.math.sum(qml.math.stack(results))

      return [tape1, tape2], processing_fn
  ```

  We can transform a QNode directly using decorator syntax:

  ```pycon
  >>> @my_transform(0.65, 2.5)
  ... @qml.qnode(dev)
  ... def circuit(x):
  ...     qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
  ...     qml.RX(x, wires=0)
  ...     return qml.expval(qml.PauliX(0))
  >>> print(circuit(-0.5))
  1.2629730888100839
  ```

  Batch tape transforms are fully differentiable:

  ```pycon
  >>> gradient = qml.grad(circuit)(-0.5)
  >>> print(gradient)
  2.5800122591960153
  ```

  Batch transforms can also be applied to existing QNodes,

  ```pycon
  >>> new_qnode = my_transform(existing_qnode, *transform_weights)
  >>> new_qnode(weights)
  ```

  or to tapes (in which case, the processed tapes and classical post-processing
  functions are returned):

  ```pycon
  >>> tapes, fn = my_transform(tape, 0.65, 2.5)
  >>> from pennylane.interfaces.batch import execute
  >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=1)
  >>> res = execute(tapes, dev, interface="autograd", gradient_fn=qml.gradients.param_shift)
  1.2629730888100839
  ```

* Vector-Jacobian product transforms have been added to the `qml.gradients` package.
  [(#1494)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1494)

  The new transforms include:

  - `qml.gradients.vjp`
  - `qml.gradients.batch_vjp`

* Support for differentiable execution of batches of circuits has been
  added, via the beta `pennylane.interfaces.batch` module.
  [(#1501)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1501)
  [(#1508)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1508)
  [(#1542)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1542)
  [(#1549)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1549)
  [(#1608)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1608)
  [(#1618)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1618)
  [(#1637)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1637)

  For now, this is a low-level feature, and will be integrated into the QNode in a future release.
  For example:

  ```python
  from pennylane.interfaces.batch import execute

  def cost_fn(x):
      with qml.tape.JacobianTape() as tape1:
          qml.RX(x[0], wires=[0])
          qml.RY(x[1], wires=[1])
          qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
          qml.var(qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliX(1))

      with qml.tape.JacobianTape() as tape2:
          qml.RX(x[0], wires=0)
          qml.RY(x[0], wires=1)
          qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
          qml.probs(wires=1)

      result = execute(
          [tape1, tape2], dev,
          gradient_fn=qml.gradients.param_shift,
          interface="autograd"
      )
      return result[0] + result[1][0, 0]

  res = qml.grad(cost_fn)(params)
  ```

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* A new operation `qml.SISWAP` has been added, the square-root of the `qml.ISWAP` operation.
  [(#1563)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1563)

* The `frobenius_inner_product` function has been moved to the `qml.math`
  module, and is now differentiable using all autodiff frameworks.
  [(#1388)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1388)

* A warning is raised to inform the user that specifying a list of shots is
  only supported for `QubitDevice` based devices.
  [(#1659)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1659)

* The `qml.circuit_drawer.MPLDrawer` class provides manual circuit drawing
  functionality using Matplotlib. While not yet integrated with automatic circuit
  drawing, this class provides customization and control.
  [(#1484)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1484)

  ```python
  from pennylane.circuit_drawer import MPLDrawer

  drawer = MPLDrawer(n_wires=3, n_layers=3)

  drawer.label([r"$|\Psi\rangle$", r"$|\theta\rangle$", "aux"])

  drawer.box_gate(layer=0, wires=[0, 1, 2], text="Entangling Layers", text_options={'rotation': 'vertical'})
  drawer.box_gate(layer=1, wires=[0, 1], text="U(θ)")

  drawer.CNOT(layer=2, wires=[1, 2])
  drawer.measure(layer=3, wires=2)

  drawer.fig.suptitle('My Circuit', fontsize='xx-large')
  ```

  <img src="https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/drawer/example_release_notes.png" width=70%/>

* The slowest tests, more than 1.5 seconds, now have the pytest mark `slow`, and can be
  selected or deselected during local execution of tests.
  [(#1633)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1633)

* The device test suite has been expanded to cover more qubit operations and observables.
  [(#1510)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1510)

* The `MultiControlledX` class now inherits from `Operation` instead of `ControlledQubitUnitary` which makes the `MultiControlledX` gate a non-parameterized gate.
  [(#1557)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1557)

* The `utils.sparse_hamiltonian` function can now deal with non-integer
  wire labels, and it throws an error for the edge case of observables that are
  created from multi-qubit operations.
  [(#1550)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1550)

* Added the matrix attribute to `qml.templates.subroutines.GroverOperator`
  [(#1553)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1553)

* The `tape.to_openqasm()` method now has a `measure_all` argument that specifies whether the
  serialized OpenQASM script includes computational basis measurements on all of the qubits or
  just those specified by the tape.
  [(#1559)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1559)

* An error is now raised when no arguments are passed to an observable, to
  inform that wires have not been supplied.
  [(#1547)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1547)

* The `group_observables` transform is now differentiable.
  [(#1483)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1483)

  For example:

  ``` python
  import jax
  from jax import numpy as jnp

  coeffs = jnp.array([1., 2., 3.])
  obs = [PauliX(wires=0), PauliX(wires=1), PauliZ(wires=1)]

  def group(coeffs, select=None):
    _, grouped_coeffs = qml.grouping.group_observables(obs, coeffs)
    # in this example, grouped_coeffs is a list of two jax tensors
    # [DeviceArray([1., 2.], dtype=float32), DeviceArray([3.], dtype=float32)]
    return grouped_coeffs[select]

  jac_fn = jax.jacobian(group)
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> jac_fn(coeffs, select=0)
  [[1. 0. 0.]
  [0. 1. 0.]]

  >>> jac_fn(coeffs, select=1)
  [[0., 0., 1.]]
  ```

* The tape does not verify any more that all Observables have owners in the annotated queue.
  [(#1505)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1505)

  This allows manipulation of Observables inside a tape context. An example is
  `expval(Tensor(qml.PauliX(0), qml.Identity(1)).prune())` which makes the expval
  an owner of the pruned tensor and its constituent observables, but leaves the
  original tensor in the queue without an owner.

* The `qml.ResetError` is now supported for `default.mixed` device.
  [(#1541)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1541)

* `QNode.diff_method` will now reflect which method was selected from `diff_method="best"`.
  [(#1568)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1568)

* QNodes now support `diff_method=None`. This works the same as `interface=None`. Such QNodes accept
  floats, ints, lists and NumPy arrays and return NumPy output but can not be differentiated.
  [(#1585)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1585)

* QNodes now include validation to warn users if a supplied keyword argument is
  not one of the recognized arguments.
  [(#1591)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1591)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* The `QFT` operation has been moved, and is now accessible via
  `pennylane.templates.QFT`.
  [(#1548)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1548)

* Specifying `shots=None` with `qml.sample` was previously deprecated.
  From this release onwards, setting `shots=None` when sampling will
  raise an error also for `default.qubit.jax`.
  [(#1629)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1629)

* An error is raised during QNode creation when a user requests backpropagation on
  a device with finite-shots.
  [(#1588)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1588)

* The class `qml.Interferometer` is deprecated and will be renamed `qml.InterferometerUnitary`
  after one release cycle.
  [(#1546)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1546)

*  All optimizers except for Rotosolve and Rotoselect now have a public attribute `stepsize`.
  Temporary backward compatibility has been added to support the use of `_stepsize` for one
  release cycle. `update_stepsize` method is deprecated.
  [(#1625)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1625)


<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Fixed a bug with shot vectors and `Device` base class.
  [(#1666)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1666)

* Fixed a bug where `@jax.jit` would fail on a QNode that used `qml.QubitStateVector`.
  [(#1649)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1649)

* Fixed a bug related to an edge case of single-qubit `zyz_decomposition` when
  only off-diagonal elements are present.
  [(#1643)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1643)

* `MottonenStatepreparation` can now be run with a single wire label not in a list.
  [(#1620)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1620)

* Fixed the circuit representation of CY gates to align with CNOT and CZ gates when calling the circuit drawer.
  [(#1504)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/issues/1504)

* Dask and CVXPY dependent tests are skipped if those packages are not installed.
[(#1617)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/1617)
