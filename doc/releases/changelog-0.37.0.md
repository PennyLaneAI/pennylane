# Release 0.37.0 (current release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Added a quantum debugger (`PLDB`) which interfaces via `qml.breakpoint()` and provides tools for 
  debugging quantum circuits. Users can step through the quantum circuit operations, dynamically
  queue operations and make measurements using (`qml.debug_state()`, `qml.debug_probs()`, 
  `qml.debug_expval()`, and `qml.debug_tape()`). Consider the following python script 
  containing the quantum circuit with breakpoints.

* The `default.tensor` device now supports the `tn` method to simulate quantum circuits using exact tensor networks.
  [(#5786)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5786)

* QROM template is added. This template allows you to enter classic data in the form of bitstrings.
  [(#5688)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5688)

  ```python
  # a list of bitstrings is defined
  bitstrings = ["010", "111", "110", "000"]

  dev = qml.device("default.qubit", shots = 1)

  @qml.qnode(dev)
  def circuit():

      # the third index is encoded in the control wires [0, 1]
      qml.BasisEmbedding(2, wires = [0,1])

      qml.QROM(bitstrings = bitstrings,
              control_wires = [0,1],
              target_wires = [2,3,4],
              work_wires = [5,6,7])

      return qml.sample(wires = [2,3,4])
  ```
   ```pycon
  >>> print(circuit())
  [1 1 0]
  ```

* `expectation_value` was added to `qml.math` to calculate the expectation value of a matrix for pure states.
  [(#4484)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4484)

  ```pycon
  >>> state_vector = [1/np.sqrt(2), 0, 1/np.sqrt(2), 0]
  >>> operator_matrix = qml.matrix(qml.PauliZ(0), wire_order=[0,1])
  >>> qml.math.expectation_value(operator_matrix, state_vector)
  tensor(-2.23711432e-17+0.j, requires_grad=True)
  ```

* The `default.tensor` device is introduced to perform tensor network simulations of quantum circuits using the `mps` (Matrix Product State) method.
  [(#5699)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5699)

* A new `qml.noise` module which contains utility function for building `NoiseModels` 
  and an `add_noise` tranform for addding it to quantum circuits.

  [(#5794)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5794)

* `qml.TrotterProduct` is now compatible with resource tracking by inheriting from `ResourcesOperation`. 
   [(#5680)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5680)

* The wires for the `default.tensor` device are selected at runtime if they are not provided by user.
  [(#5744)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5744)

* Added `packaging` in the required list of packages.
  [(#5769)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5769).

* Logging now allows for an easier opt-in across the stack, and also extends control support to `catalyst`.
  [(#5528)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5528).

* A number of templates have been updated to be valid pytrees and PennyLane operations.
  [(#5698)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5698)

* `ctrl` now works with tuple-valued `control_values` when applied to any already controlled operation.
  [(#5725)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5725)

* Add support for 3 new pytest markers: `unit`, `integration` and `system`.
  [(#5517)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5517)

* The sorting order of parameter-shift terms is now guaranteed to resolve ties in the absolute value with the sign of the shifts.
  [(#5582)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5582)

* `qml.transforms.split_non_commuting` can now handle circuits containing measurements of multi-term observables.
  [(#5729)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5729)
  [(#5838)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5838)
  [(#5828)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5828)
  [(#5869)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5869)

* The qchem module has dedicated functions for calling `pyscf` and `openfermion` backends. The
  ``molecular_hamiltonian`` and ``molecular_dipole`` functions are moved to ``hamiltonian`` and
  ``dipole`` modules.
  [(#5553)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5553)
  [(#5863)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5863)

* `qml.from_qasm` now supports the ability to convert mid-circuit measurements from `OpenQASM 2` code, and it can now also take an
   optional argument to specify a list of measurements to be performed at the end of the circuit, just like `from_qiskit`.
   [(#5818)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5818)

* Add more fermionic-to-qubit tests to cover cases when the mapped operator is different for various mapping schemes.
  [(#5873)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5873)

<h4>Mid-circuit measurements and dynamic circuits</h4>

* The `default.qubit` device implements a depth-first tree-traversal algorithm to
  accelerate native mid-circuit measurement execution. The new implementation
  supports classical control, collecting statistics, and post-selection, along
  with all measurements enabled with `qml.dynamic_one_shot`.
  [(#5180)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5180)

* `qml.QNode` and `qml.qnode` now accept two new keyword arguments: `postselect_mode` and `mcm_method`.
  These keyword arguments can be used to configure how the device should behave when running circuits with
  mid-circuit measurements.
  [(#5679)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5679)
  [(#5833)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5833)
  [(#5850)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5850)

  * `postselect_mode="hw-like"` will indicate to devices to discard invalid shots when postselecting
    mid-circuit measurements. Use `postselect_mode="fill-shots"` to unconditionally sample the postselected
    value, thus making all samples valid. This is equivalent to sampling until the number of valid samples
    matches the total number of shots.
  * `mcm_method` will indicate which strategy to use for running circuits with mid-circuit measurements.
    Use `mcm_method="deferred"` to use the deferred measurements principle, or `mcm_method="one-shot"`
    to execute once for each shot. If using `qml.jit` with the Catalyst compiler, `mcm_method="single-branch-statistics"`
    is also available. Using this method, a single branch of the execution tree will be randomly explored.

* The `dynamic_one_shot` transform is made compatible with the Catalyst compiler.
  [(#5766)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5766)
  [(#5888)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5888)
  
* Rationalize MCM tests, removing most end-to-end tests from the native MCM test file,
  but keeping one that validates multiple mid-circuit measurements with any allowed return
  and interface end-to-end tests.
  [(#5787)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5787)

* The `dynamic_one_shot` transform uses a single auxiliary tape with a shot vector and `default.qubit` implements the loop over shots with `jax.vmap`.
  [(#5617)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5617)

* The `dynamic_one_shot` transform can be compiled with `jax.jit`.
  [(#5557)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5557)

* When using `defer_measurements` with postselecting mid-circuit measurements, operations
  that will never be active due to the postselected state are skipped in the transformed
  quantum circuit. In addition, postselected controls are skipped, as they are evaluated
  at transform time. This optimization feature can be turned off by setting `reduce_postselected=False`
  [(#5558)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5558)

  Consider a simple circuit with three mid-circuit measurements, two of which are postselecting,
  and a single gate conditioned on those measurements:

  ```python
  @qml.qnode(qml.device("default.qubit"))
  def node(x):
      qml.RX(x, 0)
      qml.RX(x, 1)
      qml.RX(x, 2)
      mcm0 = qml.measure(0, postselect=0, reset=False)
      mcm1 = qml.measure(1, postselect=None, reset=True)
      mcm2 = qml.measure(2, postselect=1, reset=False)
      qml.cond(mcm0+mcm1+mcm2==1, qml.RX)(0.5, 3)
      return qml.expval(qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(3))
  ```

  Without the new optimization, we obtain three gates, each controlled on the three measured
  qubits. They correspond to the combinations of controls that satisfy the condition
  `mcm0+mcm1+mcm2==1`:

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(qml.defer_measurements(node, reduce_postselected=False))(0.6))
  0: ──RX(0.60)──|0⟩⟨0|─╭●─────────────────────────────────────────────┤ ╭<Z@Z>
  1: ──RX(0.60)─────────│──╭●─╭X───────────────────────────────────────┤ │
  2: ──RX(0.60)─────────│──│──│───|1⟩⟨1|─╭○────────╭○────────╭●────────┤ │
  3: ───────────────────│──│──│──────────├RX(0.50)─├RX(0.50)─├RX(0.50)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>
  4: ───────────────────╰X─│──│──────────├○────────├●────────├○────────┤
  5: ──────────────────────╰X─╰●─────────╰●────────╰○────────╰○────────┤
  ```

  If we do not explicitly deactivate the optimization, we obtain a much simpler circuit:

  ```pycon
  >>> print(qml.draw(qml.defer_measurements(node))(0.6))
  0: ──RX(0.60)──|0⟩⟨0|─╭●─────────────────┤ ╭<Z@Z>
  1: ──RX(0.60)─────────│──╭●─╭X───────────┤ │
  2: ──RX(0.60)─────────│──│──│───|1⟩⟨1|───┤ │
  3: ───────────────────│──│──│──╭RX(0.50)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>
  4: ───────────────────╰X─│──│──│─────────┤
  5: ──────────────────────╰X─╰●─╰○────────┤
  ```

  There is only one controlled gate with only one control wire.

* `qml.devices.LegacyDevice` is now an alias for `qml.Device`, so it is easier to distinguish it from
  `qml.devices.Device`, which follows the new device API.
  [(#5581)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5581)

* The `dtype` for `eigvals` of `X`, `Y`, `Z` and `Hadamard` is changed from `int` to `float`, making them
  consistent with the other observables. The `dtype` of the returned values when sampling these observables
  (e.g. `qml.sample(X(0))`) is also changed to `float`.
  [(#5607)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5607)

* Sets up the framework for the development of an `assert_equal` function for testing operator comparison.
  [(#5634)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5634)
  [(#5858)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5858)

* `qml.sample` can now be used on Boolean values representing mid-circuit measurement results in
  traced quantum functions. This feature is used with Catalyst to enable the pattern
  `m = measure(0); qml.sample(m)`.
  [(#5673)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5673)

* PennyLane operators, measurements, and QNodes can now automatically be captured as instructions in JAXPR.
  [(#5564)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5564)
  [(#5511)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5511)

  [(#5523)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5523)
  [(#5686)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5686)
  [(#5889)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5889)

* The `decompose` transform has an `error` kwarg to specify the type of error that should be raised,
  allowing error types to be more consistent with the context the `decompose` function is used in.
  [(#5669)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5669)

* The `qml.pytrees` module now has `flatten` and `unflatten` methods for serializing pytrees.
  [(#5701)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5701)

* Empty initialization of `PauliVSpace` is permitted.
  [(#5675)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5675)

* `MultiControlledX` can now be decomposed even when no `work_wires` are provided. The implementation returns $\mathcal{O}(\text{len(control\_wires)}^2)$ operations, and is applicable for any multi controlled unitary gate.
  [(#5735)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5735)

* Single control unitary now includes the correct global phase.
  [(#5735)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5735)

* Single control `GlobalPhase` has now a decomposition, i.e. relative phase on control wire.
  [(#5735)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5735)

* `QuantumScript` properties are only calculated when needed, instead of on initialization. This decreases the classical overhead by >20%.
  `par_info`, `obs_sharing_wires`, and `obs_sharing_wires_id` are now public attributes.
  [(#5696)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5696)
  
* The `qml.data` module now supports PyTree data types as dataset attributes
  [(#5732)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5732)


* `qml.ops.Conditional` now inherits from `qml.ops.SymbolicOp`, thus it inherits several useful common functionalities. Other properties such as adjoint and diagonalizing gates have been added using the `base` properties.
  [(##5772)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5772)

* New dispatches for `qml.ops.Conditional` and `qml.MeasurementValue` have been added to `qml.equal`.
  [(##5772)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5772)

* The `qml.qchem.Molecule` object is now the central object used by all qchem functions.
  [(#5571)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5571)

  [(#5657)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5657/)

* The qchem docs are updated with the new qchem improvements.
  [(#5758)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5758/)
  [(#5638)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5638/)
  
* `specs()` can now be requested at any specific point of the transform program through the `level` keyword argument.
  [(#5781)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5781/)

* The `qml.snapshots` transform now supports arbitrary devices by running a separate tape for each snapshot for unsupported devices.
  [(#5805)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5805)

* The `qml.Snapshot` operator now accepts sample-based measurements for finite-shot devices.
  [(#5805)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5805)
* Device preprocess transforms now happen inside the ml boundary.
  [(#5791)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5791)

* `qml.qchem.molecular_dipole` function is added for calculating the dipole operator using "dhf" and "openfermion" backends.
  [(#5764)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5764)

* Circuits can now be plotted at any specific point of the transform program through the `level` keyword argument in `draw()` and `draw_mpl()`.
  [(#5855)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5855)

* Transforms applied to callables now use `functools.wraps` to preserve the docstring and call signature of the original function.
  [(#5857)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5857)

<h4>Community contributions 🥳</h4>

* `qml.qsvt()` now supports jax arrays with angle conversions. 
  [(#5853)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5853)

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* Passing `shots` as a keyword argument to a `QNode` initialization now raises an error, instead of ignoring the input.
  [(#5748)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5748)

* A custom decomposition can no longer be provided to `QDrift`. Instead, apply the operations in your custom
  operation directly with `qml.apply`.
  [(#5698)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5698)

* Sampling observables composed of `X`, `Y`, `Z` and `Hadamard` now returns values of type `float` instead of `int`.
  [(#5607)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5607)

* `qml.is_commuting` no longer accepts the `wire_map` argument, which does not bring any functionality.
  [(#5660)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5660)

* `qml.from_qasm_file` has been removed. The user can open files and load their content using `qml.from_qasm`.
  [(#5659)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5659)

* `qml.load` has been removed in favour of more specific functions, such as `qml.from_qiskit`, etc.
  [(#5654)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5654)

* `qml.transforms.convert_to_numpy_parameters` is now a proper transform and its output signature has changed,
  returning a list of `QuantumTape`s and a post-processing function instead of simply the transformed circuit.
  [(#5693)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5693)

* `Controlled.wires` does not include `self.work_wires` anymore. That can be accessed separately through `Controlled.work_wires`.
  Consequently, `Controlled.active_wires` has been removed in favour of the more common `Controlled.wires`.
  [(#5728)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5728)

<h3>Deprecations 👋</h3>

* The `simplify` argument in `qml.Hamiltonian` and `qml.ops.LinearCombination` is deprecated.
  Instead, `qml.simplify()` can be called on the constructed operator.
  [(#5677)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5677)

* `qml.transforms.map_batch_transform` is deprecated, since a transform can be applied directly to a batch of tapes.
  [(#5676)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5676)

* The default behaviour of `qml.from_qasm()` to remove measurements in the QASM code is deprecated. Use `measurements=[]` to keep this behaviour or `measurements=None` to keep the measurements from the QASM code.
  [(#5882)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5882)

<h3>Documentation 📝</h3>

* Move information about mid-circuit measurements from the measurements quickstart page to its own
  [mid-circuit measurements quickstart page](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/mid_circuit_measurements.html)
  [(#5870)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5870)

* `qml.matrix` is now compatible with qnodes compiled by catalyst.qjit.
  [(#5753)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5753)

* `qml.snapshots` raises an error when a measurement other than `qml.state` is requested from `default.qubit.legacy` instead of silently returning the statevector.
  [(#5805)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5805)

* Fixes a bug where `default.qutrit` is falsely determined to be natively compatible with `qml.snapshots`.
  [(#5805)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5805)

* Fixes a bug where the measurement of a `qml.Snapshot` instance is not passed on during the `qml.adjoint` and `qml.ctrl` operations.
  [(#5805)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5805)

* `CNOT` and `Toffoli` now have an `arithmetic_depth` of `1`, as they are controlled operations.

  [(#5827)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5827)

* Simplify method for `Exp` now returns an operator with the correct number of Trotter steps, i.e. equal to the one from the pre-simplified operator.
  [(#5831)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5831)

* Fix bug where `CompositeOp.overlapping_ops` sometimes puts overlapping ops in different groups, leading to incorrect results returned by `LinearCombination.eigvals()`
  [(#5847)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5847)

* Implement the correct decomposition for a `qml.PauliRot` with an identity as `pauli_word`, i.e. returns a `qml.GlobalPhase` with half the angle.
