# Release 0.3.0

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* PennyLane now includes a new `interfaces` submodule, which enables QNode integration with additional machine learning libraries.
* Adds support for an experimental PyTorch interface for QNodes
* Adds support for an experimental TensorFlow eager execution interface for QNodes
* Adds a PyTorch+GPU+QPU tutorial to the documentation
* Documentation now includes links and tutorials including the new [PennyLane-Forest](https://github.com/rigetti/pennylane-forest) plugin.

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* Printing a QNode object, via `print(qnode)` or in an interactive terminal, now displays more useful information regarding the QNode,
  including the device it runs on, the number of wires, it's interface, and the quantum function it uses:

  ```python
  >>> print(qnode)
  <QNode: device='default.qubit', func=circuit, wires=2, interface=PyTorch>
  ```
