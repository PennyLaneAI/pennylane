Contribution
------------

We encourage contributions — simply fork the PennyLane repository, and then make a
`pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`_ containing your contribution. All contributers to PennyLane will be listed as authors on the releases. **All users who contribute significantly to the code (new plugins, new functionality, etc.) will be listed on the PennyLane arXiv paper.**

We also encourage bug reports, suggestions for new features and enhancements, and even links to cool projects or applications built on PennyLane.

**Update**: big announcement! We're excited to launch the Xanadu Quantum Software Competition, with prizes of up
to $1000 on offer. Submissions close 30th August 2019 — so no excuse not to submit your PennyLane
contribution, whether its an informative Jupyter notebook, PennyLane plugin, or a cool research result.

See the [competition website](https://pennylane.ai/competition) or our
[blog post](https://medium.com/xanaduai/announcing-the-xanadu-quantum-software-competition-bdcd3d6d53a9) for more.

See our `contributions page <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
