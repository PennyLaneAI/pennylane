.. currentmodule:: pennylane

The User Documentation is a reference for all methods
that are relevant for a **user** of PennyLane.

Here you can find information on the following building blocks of
PennyLane:

* **Quantum Nodes**

  Summarises everything related to constructing and running a quantum circuit in PennyLane.

* **Quantum operations**

  Lists all operations allowed in a quantum circuit, such as gates and observables.

* **Measurement outcomes**

  Introduces the possible results to get from a measurement, i.e. expectation values,
  variances and samples.

* **Circuit templates**

  Available subroutines, like layers and input embeddings, that PennyLane
  creates for ease of use.

* **Optimization methods**

  Lists the optimizers that can be used for basic quantum nodes, such as
  Gradient Descent and Adagrad.

* **Configuration**

  Shows how you can save your PennyLane configuration, for example the number
  of shots for a device.

If you are interested in developing PennyLane or if you want to know more about the
code, visit the :ref:`Developer API <_developer_overview>`.
If you want to write a plugin that connects PennyLane to hardware
and simulator backends, visit the :ref:`Plugin API <_plugin_overview>`.

For a summary of *all* modules, refer to the :ref:`modindex`, and all methods
can be found in the :ref:`genindex`.
