PennyLane
#########

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

PennyLane is a Python library for building and training machine learning models which include quantum computer circuits.

Features
========

- *Follow the gradient*.
  Built-in **automatic differentiation** of quantum circuits

- *Best of both worlds*.
  Support for **hybrid quantum and classical** models

- *Batteries included*.
  Provides **optimization and machine learning** tools

- *Device independent*.
  The same quantum circuit model can be **run on different backends**

- *Large plugin ecosystem*.
  Install plugins to run your computational circuits on more devices, including `Strawberry Fields <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-sf>`_ and `ProjectQ <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-pq>`_

Getting started
===============

To get PennyLane installed and running on your system, begin at the :ref:`download and installation guide <installation>`. Then, familiarize yourself with the PennyLane's :ref:`key concepts <introduction>` for machine learning on quantum circuits.

For getting started with PennyLane, check out our basic :ref:`qubit rotation <qubit_rotation>`, :ref:`Gaussian transformation <gaussian_transformation>`, and :ref:`hybrid quantum optimization <plugins_hybrid>` tutorials. More advanced tutorials include supervised learning, quantum classifiers, and quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs).

Next, play around with the numerous devices and :ref:`plugins <plugins>` available for running your hybrid models â€” these include Strawberry Fields, provided by the `PennyLane-SF <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-pq>`_ plugin, and the IBM QX4 quantum chip, provided by the `PennyLane-PQ <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-pq>`_ plugin.

Finally, detailed documentation on the PennyLane :ref:`interface <library_overview>` and API is provided. Look there for full details on available quantum operations and expectations, and detailed guides on :ref:`how to write your own <developer_overview>` PennyLane compatible quantum device.
