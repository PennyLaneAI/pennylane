- *Follow the gradient*.
  Built-in **automatic differentiation** of quantum circuits

..

- *Best of both worlds*.
  Support for **hybrid quantum and classical** models

..

- *Batteries included*.
  Provides **optimization and machine learning** tools

..

- *Device independent*.
  The same quantum circuit model can be **run on different backends**

..

- *Compatible with existing machine learning libraries*.
  Quantum circuits can be set up to interface with either **NumPy**, **PyTorch**, or **TensorFlow**,
  allowing hybrid CPU-GPU-QPU computations.

..

- *Large plugin ecosystem*.
  Install plugins to run your computational circuits on more devices, including **Strawberry Fields**, **Rigetti Forest**, **ProjectQ**, **Microsoft QDK**, and **IBM Q**

:html:`<h4>Available plugins</h4>`

* `PennyLane-SF <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-sf>`__: Supports integration with `Strawberry Fields <https://github.com/XanaduAI/strawberryfields>`__, a full-stack Python library for simulating continuous variable (CV) quantum optical circuits.

:html:`<h2>Getting started</h2>`

To get PennyLane installed and running on your system, begin at the
:ref:`download and installation guide <installation>`. Then, familiarize yourself with the PennyLane's
:ref:`key concepts <key_concepts>` for machine learning on quantum circuits.

For getting started with PennyLane, read the :ref:`introduction <pl_intro>` to learn about the different
building blocks. For your first hands-on experience, check out our basic :ref:`qubit rotation <qubit_rotation>`,
and :ref:`Gaussian transformation <gaussian_transformation>` tutorials, before continuing on to
explore :ref:`hybrid quantum optimization <plugins_hybrid>`, and :ref:`hybrid GPU-QPU optimization
via PyTorch <pytorch_noise>`. More advanced tutorials include supervised learning, building quantum GANs (QGANs),
and quantum classifiers.

Next, play around with the numerous devices and :ref:`plugins <plugins>` available for running your hybrid
models â€” these include Strawberry Fields, provided by the
`PennyLane-SF <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-sf>`_ plugin, the Rigetti Aspen-1 QPU, provided by the
`PennyLane-Forest <https://github.com/rigetti/pennylane-forest>`_ plugin, and the IBM QX4 quantum chip,
provided by the `PennyLane-PQ <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-pq>`_ and
`PennyLane-qiskit <https://github.com/carstenblank/pennylane-qiskit>`_ plugins. You can also find detailed guides on
:ref:`how to write your own <plugin_overview>` PennyLane compatible quantum device.

Finally, detailed documentation on the PennyLane API :ref:`interface <api_qml>` is provided.
Look there for full details on available tools to construct quantum circuits.
