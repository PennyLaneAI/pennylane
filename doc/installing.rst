Installation
============

Installation of PennyLane, as well as all required Python packages mentioned above, can be installed via ``pip``:

   	$ python -m pip install pennylane


Make sure you are using the Python 3 version of pip.

Alternatively, you can install PennyLane from the source code on Github by navigating to an appropriate installation directory on your system and running
::

	$ git clone https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane
        $ cd pennylane
        $ pip install -e .


Software tests
==============

The PennyLane test suite requires the Python pytest package; this can be installed via ``pip``:
::

	$ python -m pip install pytest

To ensure that PennyLane is working correctly, the test suite can then be run by navigating to the source code folder and running
::

	$ make test
