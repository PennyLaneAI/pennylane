Advanced features
=================

In the previous three introductory tutorials (:ref:`qubit rotation <qubit_rotation>` and :ref:`photon redirection <photon_redirection>`) we explored the basic concepts of PennyLane, including qubit- and CV-model quantum computations, gradient-based optimization, and the construction of hybrid classical-quantum computations. In this tutorial, we highlight some of the more advanced features of Pennylane. 

Multiple expectation values
===========================

All the previous examples we considered utilized quantum nodes with only single expectation values; in this section, we consider quantum nodes with more than one expectation value.
