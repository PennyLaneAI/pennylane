Multiple expectation values
===========================

In the previous two introductory tutorials (:ref:`qubit rotation <qubit_rotation>` and :ref:`photon redirection <photon_redirection>`) we explored the basic concepts of PennyLane, including optimization and the construction of hybrid classical-quantum computational graphs.

All the previous examples we considered utilized quantum nodes with only single expectation values; in this tutorial, we consider quantum nodes with more than one expectation value.
