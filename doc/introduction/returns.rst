QNode returns
=============

Version 0.30.0 of PennyLane updated the return type of a :class:`~.pennylane.QNode`. This page
provides additional details about the update and can be used to troubleshoot issues.

Summary of the update
---------------------

.. highlights::

    PennyLane QNodes now return exactly what you tell them to! ðŸŽ‰

Consider the following circuit:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml

    dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=1)

    @qml.qnode(dev)
    def circuit(x):
        qml.RX(x, wires=0)
        return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0)), qml.probs(0)

In version 0.29 and earlier of PennyLane, ``circuit()`` would return a single length-3 array:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> circuit(0.5)
    tensor([0.87758256, 0.93879128, 0.06120872], requires_grad=True)

In versions 0.30 and above, ``circuit()`` returns a length-2 tuple containing the expectation value
and probabilities separately:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> circuit(0.5)
    (tensor(0.87758256, requires_grad=True),
     tensor([0.93879128, 0.06120872], requires_grad=True))

Motivation
----------

PennyLane has historically adopted the approach of combining the returned
:ref:`measurements <intro_ref_meas>` of a QNode into a single array. However, this has presented
some challenges:

* The return of a QNode could be different to what is expected, as shown in the example above.
* For measurements of different shapes, ragged arrays were generated internally and then squeezed
  into a single output array. This was incompatible with NumPy's
  `NEP 34 <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0034-infer-dtype-is-object.html>`__ and constrained the
  `version of NumPy <https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/blob/v0.29.1/setup.py#L21>`__ that
  PennyLane was compatible with.
* Use of stacking and squeezing presented performance bottlenecks.

The changes made in PennyLane version 0.30 address the challenges above. However, existing users
may experience breaking changes or issues.

Who might be affected?
----------------------

You may experience issues with PennyLane's updated QNode return system in version 0.30 and above
if:

* You have existing code that works with PennyLane version 0.29 or below.

* You are using a QNode that returns more than one quantity, and:

  * You are calculating the Jacobian of the QNode in :ref:`NumPy <numpy_interf>` or
    :ref:`TensorFlow <tf_interf>`;

  * You are returning differently-shaped quantities together, such as :func:`~.expval` and
    :func:`~.probs`.

* You are a :ref:`device developer <plugin_overview>`, and:

  * Your device inherits from :class:`~.Device`,

  * Your device inherits from :class:`~.QubitDevice` and have overriden the
    :meth:`~.QubitDevice.statistics` method.
