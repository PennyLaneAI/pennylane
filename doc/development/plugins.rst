Building a plugin
=================

Writing your own PennyLane plugin, to allow an external quantum library to take advantage of the
automatic differentiation ability of PennyLane, is a simple and easy process. In this section,
we will walk through the steps for creating your own PennyLane plugin. In addition, we also
provide two default reference plugins â€” :mod:`'default.qubit' <.default_qubit>` for basic pure
state qubit simulations, and :mod:`'default.gaussian' <.default_gaussian>` for basic Gaussian
continuous-variable simulations.


What a plugin provides
----------------------

A quick primer on terminology of PennyLane plugins in this section:

* A plugin is an external Python package that provides additional quantum *devices* to PennyLane.

* Each plugin may provide one (or more) devices, that are accessible directly through
  PennyLane, as well as any additional private functions or classes.

* Depending on the scope of the plugin, you may wish to provide additional (custom)
  quantum operations and observables that the user can import.

.. important::

    In your plugin module, **standard NumPy** (*not* the wrapped NumPy module provided by
    PennyLane) should be imported in all places (i.e., ``import numpy as np``).


Creating your device
--------------------

.. note::

    A handy `plugin template repository <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-plugin-template>`__
    is available, providing the boilerplate and file structure required to easily create your
    own PennyLane plugin, as well as a suite of integration tests to ensure the plugin
    returns correct expectation values.

The first step in creating your PennyLane plugin is to create your device class.
This is as simple as importing the abstract base class :class:`~.Device` from PennyLane, and subclassing it:

.. code-block:: python

    from pennylane import Device

    class MyDevice(Device):
        """MyDevice docstring"""
        name = 'My custom device'
        short_name = 'example.mydevice'
        pennylane_requires = '0.1.0'
        version = '0.0.1'
        author = 'Ada Lovelace'

Here, we have begun defining some important class attributes that allow PennyLane to identify
and use the device. These include:

* :attr:`.Device.name`: a string containing the official name of the device

* :attr:`.Device.short_name`: the string used to identify and load the device by users of PennyLane

* :attr:`.Device.pennylane_requires`: the PennyLane version this device supports.
  Note that this class attribute supports pip *requirements.txt* style version ranges,
  for example:

  - ``pennylane_requires = "2"`` to support PennyLane version 2.x.x
  - ``pennylane_requires = ">=0.1.5,<0.6"`` to support a range of PennyLane versions

* :attr:`.Device.version`: the version number of the device

* :attr:`.Device.author`: the author of the device

Defining all these attributes is mandatory.

.. note::

    For examples of subclasses of :class:`~.Device`, see :class:`~.DefaultQubit`,
    :class:`~.DefaultGaussian`, or the `Qiskit <https://pennylane-qiskit.readthedocs.io/>`_
    plugin.


Supporting operators and observables
------------------------------------

You must further tell PennyLane about the operations and observables that your device supports
as well as potential further capabilities, by providing the following class attributes/properties:

* :attr:`.Device.operations`: a set of the supported PennyLane operations as strings, e.g.,

  .. code-block:: python

    operations = {"CNOT", "PauliX"}

  This is used to decide whether an operation is supported by your device in the
  default implementation of the public method :meth:`.Device.supports_operation`.

* :attr:`.Device.observables`: set of the supported PennyLane observables as strings, e.g.,

  .. code-block:: python

    observables = {"PauliX", "PauliZ", "Hadamard", "Hermitian"}

  This is used to decide whether an observable is supported by your device in the
  default implementation of the public method :meth:`.Device.supports_observable`.

* :attr:`.Device._capabilities`: a dictionary containing information about the capabilities of
  the device. Keys currently supported include:

  * ``'model'`` (*str*): either ``'qubit'`` or ``'CV'``.

  * ``'tensor_observables'`` (*bool*): ``True`` if the device supports measuring tensor products
    of observables, ``False`` otherwise.

For a better idea of how to best implement :attr:`.Device.operations` and
:attr:`.Device.observables`, refer to the two reference plugins.

.. note::

    When writing a plugin device for PennyLane, make sure that your plugin
    supports as many of the PennyLane built-in operations as possible.

    If the convention differs between the built-in PennyLane operation
    and the corresponding operation in the targeted framework, ensure that the
    conversion between the two conventions takes place automatically
    by the plugin device.

Device execution
----------------

Once all the class attributes are defined, it is necessary to define some required class
methods, to allow PennyLane to apply operations and measure observables on your device.

Applying operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To execute operations on the device, the following method must be defined:

* :meth:`.Device.apply`: This accepts an operation name (as a string), the wires (subsystems)
  to apply the operation to, and the parameters for the operation, and should apply the
  resulting operation to given wires of the device.

Measuring observables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PennyLane supports three measurement functions, :func:`.expval`, :func:`.var`,
and :func:`.sample`. To support these operations, the following methods must be defined:

* :meth:`.Device.expval`: This accepts an observable name (as a string), the wires
  (subsystems) to measure, and the parameters for the observable. It is expected to return
  the resulting expectation value from the device.

* :meth:`.Device.var`: This accepts an observable name (as a string), the wires (subsystems)
  to measure, and the parameters for the observable. It is expected to return the resulting
  variance of the measured observable value from the device.

* :meth:`.Device.sample`: This accepts an observable name (as a string), the wires (subsystems)
  to measure, and the parameters for the observable. It is expected to return samples of the
  measured observable value from the device. Number of samples is determined by attribute
  :attr:`.Device.shots`.

.. note::

    Currently, PennyLane only supports measurements that return a scalar value.

Tensor observables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A user may specify multi-wire observables using either :class:`pennylane.Hermitian` and
providing an Hermitian NumPy array, or by declaring a tensor product of single-wire observables
using the syntax ``qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1)``.

If you would like to support tensor observables, make sure to specify ``tensor_observables: True``
in the :attr:`~.Device._capabilities` dictionary. When a measurement function is called
with a tensor product of observables, each argument (``observable``, ``wires``, ``par``)
become lists of equal size.

For example, for ``qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.Hermitian(A, [1, 3])``,
the :meth:`~.Device.expval` method will be called as follows from PennyLane:

.. code-block:: python

    result = dev.expval(["PauliX, Hermitian"], wires=[[0], [1, 3]], par=[[], [A]])


Advanced execution control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additional flexibility is sometimes required for interfacing with more
complicated frameworks.

When PennyLane needs to evaluate a QNode, it accesses the :meth:`~.Device.execute` method of
your plugin, which, by default performs the following process:

.. code-block:: python

    results = []

    with self.execution_context():
        self.pre_apply()
        for operation in queue:
            self.apply(operation.name, operation.wires, operation.parameters)
        self.post_apply()

        self.pre_measure()

        for obs in observables:
            if obs.return_type is Expectation:
                results.append(self.expval(obs.name, obs.wires, obs.parameters))

            elif obs.return_type is Variance:
                results.append(self.var(obs.name, obs.wires, obs.parameters))

            elif obs.return_type is Sample:
                results.append(np.array(self.sample(obs.name, obs.wires, obs.parameters)))

        self.post_measure()

        return np.array(results)

where ``queue`` is a list of PennyLane :class:`~.Operation` instances to be applied,
and ``observables`` is a list of PennyLane :class:`~.Observable` instances to be
measured and returned.

.. important::

    At any point, the properties :attr:`self.op_queue <~.Device.op_queue>`
    and :attr:`self.obs_queue <~.Device.obs_queue>` can be used to 'peek'
    at the operation and observable queues respectively.

In cases where additional logic is required, the following (optional) methods may
also be implemented:

* :meth:`.Device.__init__`: By default, this method receives the number of wires
  (``self.num_wires``) and number of shots ``self.shots`` of the device. This is the right place to set
  up your device. You may add parameters while overwriting this method if you need to add additional
  options that the user must pass to the device on initialization. Make sure that you call
  ``super().__init__(wires, shots)`` at some point here.

* :meth:`.Device.execution_context`: Here you may return a context manager for the circuit
  execution phase (see above). You can implement this method if the quantum library for which you are writing the device requires such an execution context while applying operations and measuring results from the device.

* :meth:`.Device.pre_apply`: for any setup/code that must be executed before applying operations

* :meth:`.Device.post_apply`: for any setup/code that must be executed after applying operations

* :meth:`.Device.pre_measure`: for any setup/code that must be executed before measuring observables

* :meth:`.Device.post_measure`: for any setup/code that must be executed after measuring observables

.. warning::

    In advanced cases, the :meth:`.Device.execute` method may be overwritten directly.
    This provides full flexibility for handling the device execution yourself. However,
    this may have unintended side-effects and is not recommended â€” if possible, try implementing
    a suitable subset of the methods provided above.


Identifying and installing your device
--------------------------------------

When performing a hybrid computation using PennyLane, one of the first steps is often to
initialize the quantum device(s). PennyLane identifies the devices via their ``short_name``,
which allows the device to be initialized in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml
    dev1 = qml.device(short_name, wires=2)

where ``short_name`` is a string that uniquely identifies the device. The ``short_name``
has the following form: ``pluginname.devicename``. Examples include ``'default.qubit'``
and ``'default.gaussian'`` which are provided as reference plugins by PennyLane, as well as
``'strawberryfields.fock'``, ``'strawberryfields.gaussian'``, ``'qiskit.ibmq'``, and
``'qiskit.aer'``, which are provided by the
`PennyLane StrawberryFields <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-sf>`_ and
`PennyLane Qiskit <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit>`_ plugins, respectively.

PennyLane uses a ``setuptools`` ``entry_points`` approach to plugin discovery/integration.
In order to make the devices of your plugin accessible to PennyLane, simply provide the
following keyword argument to the ``setup()`` function in your ``setup.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

    devices_list = [
            'example.mydevice1 = MyModule.MySubModule:MyDevice1'
            'example.mydevice2 = MyModule.MySubModule:MyDevice2'
        ],
    setup(entry_points={'pennylane.plugins': devices_list})

where ``devices_list`` is a list of devices you would like to register, ``example.mydevice1``
is the short name of the device, and ``MyModule.MySubModule`` is the path to your Device class,
``MyDevice1``.

To ensure your device is working as expected, you can install it in developer mode using
``pip install -e pluginpath``, where ``pluginpath`` is the location of the plugin. It will
then be accessible via PennyLane.


Testing
-------

All plugins should come with extensive unit tests, to ensure that the device supports the correct
gates and observables, and is applying them correctly. For an example of a plugin test suite, see
``tests/test_default_qubit.py`` and ``tests/test_default_gaussian.py`` in the main
`PennyLane repository <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/>`_.

Integration tests to check that the expectation values, variance, and samples are correct for
various circuits and observables are provided in the
`PennyLane Plugin Template <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-plugin-template>`__ repository.

In general, as all supported operations have their gradient formula defined and tested by
PennyLane, testing that your device calculates the correct gradients is not required â€” just
that it *applies* and *measures* quantum operations and observables correctly.


Supporting new operations
-------------------------

If you would like to support an operation or observable that is not currently supported by
PennyLane, you can subclass the :class:`~.Operation` and :class:`~.Observable` classes, and
define the number of parameters the operation takes, and the number of wires the operation
acts on. For example, to define a custom gate depending on parameter :math:`\phi`,

.. code-block:: python

    class CustomGate(Operation):
        """Custom gate"""
        num_params = 1
        num_wires = 2
        par_domain = 'R'
        grad_method = 'A'
        grad_recipe = None

where

* :attr:`~.Operator.num_params`: the number of parameters the operation takes

* :attr:`~.Operator.num_wires`: the number of wires the operation acts on.

  You may use :attr:`pennylane.operation.All` to represent an operation that
  acts on all wires, or :attr:`pennylane.operation.Any` to represent an operation that
  can act on any number of wires (for example, operations where the number of
  wires they act on is a function of the operation parameter).

* :attr:`~.Operator.par_domain`: the domain of the gate parameters; ``'N'`` for natural
  numbers (including zero), ``'R'`` for floats, ``'A'`` for arrays of floats/complex numbers,
  and ``None`` if the gate does not have free parameters

* :attr:`~.Operation.grad_method`: the gradient computation method; ``'A'`` for the analytic
  method, ``'F'`` for finite differences, and ``None`` if the operation may not be differentiated

* :attr:`~.Operation.grad_recipe`: The gradient recipe for the analytic ``'A'`` method.
  This is a list with one tuple per operation parameter. For parameter :math:`k`, the tuple is of
  the form :math:`(c_k, s_k)`, resulting in a gradient recipe of

  .. math:: \frac{d}{d\phi_k}f(O(\phi_k)) = c_k\left[f(O(\phi_k+s_k))-f(O(\phi_k-s_k))\right].

  where :math:`f` is an expectation value that depends on :math:`O(\phi_k)`, an example being

  .. math:: f(O(\phi_k)) = \braket{0 | O^{\dagger}(\phi_k) \hat{B} O(\phi_k) | 0}

  which is the simple expectation value of the operator :math:`\hat{B}` evolved via the gate
  :math:`O(\phi_k)`.

Note that if ``grad_recipe = None``, the default gradient recipe is
:math:`(c_k, s_k)=(1/2, \pi/2)` for every parameter.

The user can then import this operation directly from your plugin, and use it when defining a QNode:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml
    from MyModule.MySubModule import CustomGate

    @qnode(dev1)
    def my_qfunc(phi):
        qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
        CustomGate(phi, wires=[0,1])
        return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

.. warning::

    If you are providing custom operations not natively supported by PennyLane, it is recommended
    that the plugin unittests **do** provide tests to ensure that PennyLane returns the correct
    gradient for the custom operations.


Supporting new CV operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For custom continuous-variable operations or observables, the :class:`~.CVOperation` or
:class:`~.CVObservable` classes must be subclassed instead.

In addition, for Gaussian CV operations, you may need to provide the static class method
:meth:`~.CV._heisenberg_rep` that returns the Heisenberg representation of the operator given
its list of parameters:

.. code-block:: python

    class Custom(CVOperation):
        """Custom gate"""
        n_params = 2
        n_wires = 1
        par_domain = 'R'
        grad_method = 'A'
        grad_recipe = None

        @staticmethod
        def _heisenberg_rep(params):
            return function(params)

* For operations, the ``_heisenberg_rep`` method should return the matrix of the linear
  transformation carried out by the gate for the given parameter values. This is used internally for
  calculating the gradient using the analytic method (``grad_method = 'A'``).

* For observables, this method should return a real vector (first-order observables) or symmetric
  matrix (second-order observables) of coefficients which represent the expansion of the observable in
  the basis of monomials of the quadrature operators.

  - For single-mode Operations we use the basis :math:`\mathbf{r} = (\I, \x, \p)`.

  - For multi-mode Operations we use the basis :math:`\mathbf{r} = (\I, \x_0, \p_0, \x_1, \p_1,
    \ldots)`, where :math:`\x_k` and :math:`\p_k` are the quadrature operators of qumode :math:`k`.

Non-Gaussian CV operations and observables are currently only supported via the finite difference
method of gradient computation.
