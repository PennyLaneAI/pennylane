Building a plugin
=================

Writing your own PennyLane plugin, to allow an external quantum library to take advantage of the
automatic differentiation ability of PennyLane, is a simple and easy process. In this section,
we will walk through the steps for creating your own PennyLane plugin. In addition, we also
provide two default reference plugins â€” :mod:`'default.qubit' <.default_qubit>` for basic pure
state qubit simulations, and :mod:`'default.gaussian' <.default_gaussian>` for basic
continuous-variable simulations.


What a plugin provides
----------------------

A quick primer on terminology of PennyLane plugins in this section:

* A plugin is an external Python package that provides additional quantum *devices* to PennyLane.

* Each plugin may provide one (or more) devices, that are accessible directly through
  PennyLane, as well as any additional private functions or classes.

* Depending on the scope of the plugin, you may wish to provide additional (custom)
  quantum operations and observables that the user can import.

.. important::

    In your plugin module, **standard NumPy** (*not* the wrapped Autograd version of NumPy)
    should be imported in all places (i.e., ``import numpy as np``).


Creating your device
--------------------

The first step in creating your PennyLane plugin is to create your device class.
This is as simple as importing the abstract base class :class:`~.QubitDevice` from PennyLane,
and subclassing it:

.. code-block:: python

    from pennylane import QubitDevice

    class MyDevice(QubitDevice):
        """MyDevice docstring"""
        name = 'My custom device'
        short_name = 'example.mydevice'
        pennylane_requires = '0.1.0'
        version = '0.0.1'
        author = 'Ada Lovelace'

Here, we have begun defining some important class attributes that allow PennyLane to identify
and use the device. These include:

* :attr:`.Device.name`: a string containing the official name of the device

* :attr:`.Device.short_name`: the string used to identify and load the device by users of PennyLane

* :attr:`.Device.pennylane_requires`: the PennyLane version this device supports.
  Note that this class attribute supports pip *requirements.txt* style version ranges,
  for example:

  - ``pennylane_requires = "2"`` to support PennyLane version 2.x.x
  - ``pennylane_requires = ">=0.1.5,<0.6"`` to support a range of PennyLane versions

* :attr:`.Device.version`: the version number of the device

* :attr:`.Device.author`: the author of the device

Defining all these attributes is mandatory.


Device capabilities
-------------------

You must further tell PennyLane about the operations that your device supports, 
as well as potential further capabilities, by providing the following class attributes/properties:

* :attr:`.Device.operations`: a set of the supported PennyLane operations as strings, e.g.,

  .. code-block:: python

    operations = {"CNOT", "PauliX"}

  See :doc:`/introduction/operations` for a full list of operations
  supported by PennyLane.

  If your device does not natively support an operation that has the
  :meth:`~.Operation.decomposition` static method defined, PennyLane will
  attempt to decompose the operation before calling the device. For example,
  the :class:`~.Rot` `decomposition method <../_modules/pennylane/ops/qubit.html#Rot.decomposition>`_ will
  decompose the single-qubit rotation gate to :class:`~.RZ` and :class:`~.RY` gates.

  .. note::

      If the convention differs between the built-in PennyLane operation
      and the corresponding operation in the targeted framework, ensure that the
      conversion between the two conventions takes place automatically
      by the plugin device.

* :func:`.Device.capabilities`: A class method which returns the dictionary of capabilities of a device. A
  new device should override this method to retrieve the parent classes' capabilities dictionary, make a copy
  and update and/or add capabilities before returning the copy.

  Examples of capabilities are:

  * ``'model'`` (*str*): either ``'qubit'`` or ``'cv'``.

  * ``'returns_state'`` (*bool*): ``True`` if the device returns the quantum state via ``dev.state``.

  * ``'supports_inverse_operations'`` (*bool*): ``True`` if the device supports
    applying the inverse of operations. Operations which should be inverted
    have the property ``operation.inverse == True``.

  *  ``'supports_tensor_observables'`` (*bool*): ``True`` if the device supports observables composed from tensor
     products such as ``PauliZ(wires=0) @ PauliZ(wires=1)``.

  Some capabilities are queried by PennyLane core to make decisions on how to best run computations, others are used
  by external apps built on top of the device ecosystem.

  To find out which capabilities are (possibly automatically) defined for your device ``dev = device('my.device')``,
  check the output of ``dev.capabilities()``.

Adding arguments to your device
--------------------------------

.. important::

    PennyLane supports both qubit and continuous-variable (CV) devices. However, from
    here onwards, we will demonstrate plugin development focusing on qubit-based devices
    inheriting from the :class:`~.QubitDevice` class.

Defining the ``__init__.py`` method of a custom device is not necessary; by default,
the :class:`~.QubitDevice` initialization will be called, where the user can pass the
following arguments:

* ``wires`` (*int* or *Iterable[Number, str]*): The number of subsystems represented by the device,
  or iterable that contains unique labels for the subsystems as numbers (i.e., ``[-1, 0, 2]``)
  and/or strings (``['ancilla', 'q1', 'q2']``).

* ``shots=1000`` (*int*): number of circuit evaluations/random samples used to estimate
  expectation values of observables in non-analytic mode.

* ``analytic=True`` (*bool*): If ``True``, the device calculates probability, expectation
  values, and variances analytically. If ``False``, a finite number of samples
  are used to estimate these quantities. Note that hardware devices should always set
  ``analytic=False``.

To add your own device arguments, or to override any of the above defaults, simply
overwrite the ``__init__.py`` method. For example, here is a device where the number
of wires is fixed to ``24``, that cannot be used in analytic mode, and that can accept a dictionary
of low-level hardware control options:

.. code-block:: python3

    class CustomDevice(QubitDevice):
        name = 'My custom device'
        short_name = 'example.mydevice'
        pennylane_requires = '0.1.0'
        version = '0.0.1'
        author = 'Ada Lovelace'

        operations = {"PauliX", "RX", "CNOT"}
        observables = {"PauliZ", "PauliX", "PauliY"}

        def __init__(self, shots=1024, hardware_options=None):
            super().__init__(wires=24, shots=shots, analytic=False)
            self.hardware_options = hardware_options or hardware_defaults

Note that we have also overridden the default shot number.

The user can now pass any of these arguments to the PennyLane device loader:

>>> dev = qml.device("example.mydevice", hardware_options={"t2": 0.1})
>>> dev.hardware_options
{"t2": 0.1}


Device execution
----------------

Once all the class attributes are defined, it is necessary to define some required class
methods to allow PennyLane to apply operations and measure observables on your device.

To execute operations on the device, the following methods **must** be defined:

.. currentmodule:: pennylane.QubitDevice

.. autosummary::

    apply

If the device is a statevector simulator (it has an ``analytic`` attribute)
then it **must** also overwrite:

.. autosummary::

    analytic_probability

The :class:`~.QubitDevice` class
provides the following convenience methods that may be used by the plugin:

.. autosummary::

    active_wires
    marginal_prob

In addition, if your qubit device generates its own computational basis samples for measured wires
after execution, you need to overwrite the following method:

.. autosummary::

    generate_samples

:meth:`~.generate_samples` should return samples with shape ``(dev.shots, dev.num_wires)``.
Furthermore, PennyLane uses the convention :math:`|q_0,q_1,\dots,q_{N-1}\rangle` where
:math:`q_0` is the most significant bit.

And thats it! The device has inherited :meth:`~.QubitDevice.expval`, :meth:`~.QubitDevice.var`,
and :meth:`~.QubitDevice.sample` methods, that accepts an observable (or tensor product of
observables) and returns the corresponding measurement statistic.



:html:`<div class="caution admonition" id="aside1"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#aside1" href="#content1" class="collapsed"><p class="first admonition-title">Advanced execution control (click to expand) <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down"></i></p></a><div id="content1" class="collapse" data-parent="#aside1" style="height: 0px;">`

Additional flexibility is sometimes required for interfacing with more
complicated frameworks.

When PennyLane needs to evaluate a QNode, it accesses the :meth:`~.QubitDevice.execute` method of
your plugin which, by default, performs the following process:

.. code-block:: python

    self.check_validity(circuit.operations, circuit.observables)

    # apply all circuit operations
    self.apply(circuit.operations, rotations=circuit.diagonalizing_gates)

    # generate computational basis samples
    if (not self.analytic) or circuit.is_sampled:
        self._samples = self.generate_samples()

    # compute the required statistics
    results = self.statistics(circuit.observables)

    return self._asarray(results)

where

* ``circuit`` is a :class:`~.CircuitGraph` object

* :attr:`circuit.operations <pennylane.CircuitGraph.operations>` are the user-provided
  operations to be executed

* :attr:`circuit.observables <pennylane.CircuitGraph.observables>` are the user-provided
  observables to be measured

* :attr:`circuit.diagonalizing_gates <pennylane.CircuitGraph.diagonalizing_gates>` are the
  gates that rotate the circuit prior to measurement so that computational basis
  measurements are performed in the eigenbasis of the requested observables

* :meth:`.QubitDevice.statistics` returns the results of :meth:`.QubitDevice.expval`,
  :meth:`~.QubitDevice.var`, or :meth:`~.QubitDevice.sample` depending on the type
  of observable.

In advanced cases, the :meth:`.QubitDevice.execute` method, as well as
:meth:`.QubitDevice.statistics`, may be overwritten directly.
This provides full flexibility for handling the device execution yourself. However,
this may have unintended side-effects and is not recommended.

.. _installing_plugin:


Wire handling
-------------

PennyLane uses the :class:`~.wires.Wires` class for the internal representation of wires. :class:`~.wires.Wires`
inherits from Python's ``Sequence``, and represents an ordered set of unique wire labels.
Indexing a ``Wires`` instance will return another ``Wires`` instance of length one.
The ``labels`` attribute stores a tuple of the wire labels.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from pennylane.wires import Wires

    wires = Wires(['ancilla', 0, 1])
    print(wires[0]) # <Wires = ['ancilla']>
    print(wires.labels) # ('ancilla', 0, 1)

As shown in the section on :doc:`/introduction/circuits`, a device can be created with custom wire labels:

.. code-block:: python

    from pennylane import *

    dev = device('my.device', wires=['q11', 'q12', 'q21', 'q22'])

    @qnode(dev)
    def circuit():
       Gate1(wires='q22')
       Gate2(wires=['q21','q11'])
       Gate1(wires=['q21'])
       return expval(Obs(wires='q11') @ Obs(wires='q12'))

Behind the scenes, when ``my.device`` gets created it turns ``['q11', 'q12', 'q21', 'q22']`` into a
:class:`~.wires.Wires` object and stores it in the device's ``wires`` attribute. Likewise, when gates and
observables get created they turn their ``wires`` argument into a :class:`~.wires.Wires`
object and store it in their ``wires`` attribute.

.. code-block:: python

    print(dev.wires) #  <Wires = ['q11', 'q12', 'q21', 'q22']>

    op = Gate2(wires=['q21','q11'])
    print(op.wires) # <Wires = ['q21', 'q11']>

When the device applies operations, it needs to translate
``op.wires`` into wire labels that the backend "understands". This can be done with the
:meth:`~.Device.map_wires` method which maps ``Wires`` objects to other ``Wires`` objects,
but changes the labels according to the ``wire_map`` attribute of the device which defines the translation.

.. code-block:: python

    # inside the class defining 'my.device', which inherits from the base Device class
    device_wires = self.map_wires(op.wires)
    print(device_wires) # <Wires = [2, 0]>

By default, the map translates the custom labels ``'q11'``, ``'q12'``, ``'q21'``, ``'q22'`` to
consecutive integers ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, ``3``. If a device uses a different wire labeling,
such as non-consecutive wires ``0``, ``4``, ``7``, ``12``, the :meth:`~.Device.define_wire_map` method
has to be overwritten accordingly.

The ``device_wires`` can then be further processed, for example by extracting the actual labels as a tuple,
list or array, or by getting the number of wires:

.. code-block:: python

    device_wires.labels # (2, 0)

    device_wires.tolist() # [2, 0]

    device_wires.toarray() # ndarray([2, 0])

    len(device_wires) # 2

The ``Wires`` class also offers set functionality like identifying the unique or shared wires between several ``Wires``
object.

As a convention, devices should do the translation and unpacking as late as possible in the function tree, and
where possible pass the original :class:`~.wires.Wires` objects around.

Identifying and installing your device
--------------------------------------

When performing a hybrid computation using PennyLane, one of the first steps is often to
initialize the quantum device(s). PennyLane identifies the devices via their ``short_name``,
which allows the device to be initialized in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml
    dev1 = qml.device(short_name, wires=2)

where ``short_name`` is a string that uniquely identifies the device. The ``short_name``
should have the form ``pluginname.devicename``, using periods for delimitation.

PennyLane uses a setuptools ``entry_points`` approach to plugin discovery/integration.
In order to make the devices of your plugin accessible to PennyLane, simply provide the
following keyword argument to the ``setup()`` function in your ``setup.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

    devices_list = [
            'example.mydevice1 = MyModule.MySubModule:MyDevice1'
            'example.mydevice2 = MyModule.MySubModule:MyDevice2'
        ],
    setup(entry_points={'pennylane.plugins': devices_list})

where

* ``devices_list`` is a list of devices you would like to register,

* ``example.mydevice1`` is the short name of the device, and

* ``MyModule.MySubModule`` is the path to your Device class, ``MyDevice1``.

To ensure your device is working as expected, you can install it in developer mode using
``pip install -e pluginpath``, where ``pluginpath`` is the location of the plugin. It will
then be accessible via PennyLane.

Testing
-------

All plugins should come with extensive unit tests, to ensure that each logical unit of the
device has correct execution.

Integration tests to check that the probabilities, expectation values, variance, and samples are
correct for various circuits and observables are provided as part of the PennyLane device
test utility:


.. code-block:: console

    pl-device-test --device device_shortname --shots 10000 --analytic False

In general, as all supported operations have their gradient formula defined and tested by
PennyLane, testing that your device calculates the correct gradients is not required.
For more details on the PennyLane device test utility, see :mod:`pennylane.devices.tests`.

Supporting new operations
-------------------------

If you would like to support an operation that is not currently supported by
PennyLane, you can subclass the :class:`~.Operation` class, and
define the number of parameters the operation takes, and the number of wires the operation
acts on. For example, to define a custom gate depending on parameter :math:`\phi`,

.. code-block:: python

    class CustomGate(Operation):
        """Custom gate"""
        num_params = 2
        num_wires = 1
        par_domain = 'R'

        grad_method = 'A'
        grad_recipe = None

        @classmethod
        def _matrix(cls, *params):
            """Returns the matrix representation of the operator for the
            provided parameter values, in the computational basis."""
            return np.array([[params[0], 1], [1, -params[1]]]) / math.sqrt(2)

        @staticmethod
        def decomposition(*params, wires):
            """(Optional) Returns a list of PennyLane operations that decompose
            the custom gate."""
            return [qml.RZ(params[0]/2, wires=wires[0]), qml.PauliX(params[1], wires=wires[0])]

where

* :attr:`~.Operator.num_params`: the number of parameters the operation takes

* :attr:`~.Operator.num_wires`: the number of wires the operation acts on.

  You may use :attr:`pennylane.operation.All` to represent an operation that
  acts on all wires, or :attr:`pennylane.operation.Any` to represent an operation that
  can act on any number of wires (for example, operations where the number of
  wires they act on is a function of the operation parameter).

* :attr:`~.Operator.par_domain`: the domain of the gate parameters; ``'N'`` for natural
  numbers (including zero), ``'R'`` for floats, ``'A'`` for arrays of floats/complex numbers,
  ``'L'`` for list of arrays of floats/complex numbers and ``None`` if the gate does not have
  free parameters

* :attr:`~.Operation.grad_method`: the gradient computation method; ``'A'`` for the analytic
  method, ``'F'`` for finite differences, and ``None`` if the operation may not be differentiated

* :attr:`~.Operation.grad_recipe`: The gradient recipe for the analytic ``'A'``
  method. This is a tuple with one nested list per operation parameter. For
  parameter :math:`\phi_k`, the nested list contains elements of the form
  :math:`[c_i, a_i, s_i]`, resulting in a gradient recipe of

  .. math:: \frac{\partial}{\partial\phi_k}f(\phi_k) = \sum_{i} c_i f(a_i \phi_k+s_i),

  where :math:`f` is the expectation value of an observable on a circuit that has been evolved by
  the operation being considered with parameter :math:`\phi_k`.

  Note that if ``grad_recipe = None``, the default gradient recipe containing
  the two terms :math:`[c_0, a_0, s_0]=[1/2, 1, \pi/2]` and :math:`[c_1, a_1,
  s_1]=[-1/2, 1, -\pi/2]` is assumed for every parameter.

The user can then import this operation directly from your plugin, and use it when defining a QNode:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml
    from MyModule.MySubModule import CustomGate

    @qnode(dev1)
    def my_qfunc(phi):
        qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
        CustomGate(phi, theta, wires=0)
        return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

.. warning::

    If you are providing custom operations not natively supported by PennyLane, it is recommended
    that the plugin unit tests **do** provide tests to ensure that PennyLane returns the correct
    gradient for the custom operations.

If the custom operation is diagonal in the computational basis, it is recommended to subclass
:class:`~.DiagonalOperation`. For diagonal operations, :attr:`_eigvals` has to be overridden
instead of :attr:`_matrix`. 

.. code-block:: python

    class CustomDiagonalGate(DiagonalOperation):
        """Custom gate"""
        num_params = 0
        num_wires = 2

        @classmethod
        def _eigvals(cls, *params):
            """Returns the eigenvalues of the operation in the computational basis."""
            return np.array([1j, 1j, -1j, -1j])

        @staticmethod
        def decomposition(*params, wires):
            """(Optional) Returns a list of PennyLane operations that decompose
            the custom gate."""
            return [qml.DiagonalQubitUnitary([1j, 1j, -1j, -1j], wires=wires)]

Supporting new observables
--------------------------

Custom observables can be added in an identical manner to operations above, but with three
small changes:

* The :class:`~.Observable` class should instead be subclassed.

* The class attribute :attr:`~.Observable.eigvals` should be defined, returning
  the eigenvalues of the observable.

* The method :meth:`~.Observable.diagonalizing_gates` should be defined. This method
  returns a list of PennyLane :class:`~.Operation` objects that diagonalize the observable
  in the computational basis. This is used to support devices that can only perform
  measurements in the computational basis.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    class CustomObservable(Observable):
        """Custom observable"""
        num_params = 0
        num_wires = 1
        par_domain = None
        eigvals = np.array([0.2, 0.1])

        def diagonalizing_gates(self):
            return [PauliX(wires=self.wires), Hadamard(wires=self.wires)]

        @staticmethod
        def _matrix(*params):
            return np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]]) / math.sqrt(2)


:html:`<div class="note admonition" id="aside1"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#aside1" href="#content1" class="collapsed"><p class="first admonition-title">CV devices and operations (click to expand) <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down"></i></p></a><div id="content1" class="collapse" data-parent="#aside1" style="height: 0px;">`

**Note: CV devices currently subclass from the base** :class:`~.Device` **class. However, this
class is deprecated, and a new** ``CVDevice`` **class will be available soon.**

For custom continuous-variable operations or observables, the :class:`~.CVOperation` or
:class:`~.CVObservable` classes must be subclassed instead.

In addition, for Gaussian CV operations, you may need to provide the static class method
:meth:`~.CV._heisenberg_rep` that returns the Heisenberg representation of the operator given
its list of parameters:

.. code-block:: python

    class Custom(CVOperation):
        """Custom gate"""
        n_params = 2
        n_wires = 1
        par_domain = 'R'
        grad_method = 'A'
        grad_recipe = None

        @staticmethod
        def _heisenberg_rep(params):
            return function(params)

* For operations, the ``_heisenberg_rep`` method should return the matrix of the linear
  transformation carried out by the gate for the given parameter values. This is used internally for
  calculating the gradient using the analytic method (``grad_method = 'A'``).

* For observables, this method should return a real vector (first-order observables) or symmetric
  matrix (second-order observables) of coefficients which represent the expansion of the observable in
  the basis of monomials of the quadrature operators.

  - For single-mode Operations we use the basis :math:`\mathbf{r} = (\I, \x, \p)`.

  - For multi-mode Operations we use the basis :math:`\mathbf{r} = (\I, \x_0, \p_0, \x_1, \p_1,
    \ldots)`, where :math:`\x_k` and :math:`\p_k` are the quadrature operators of qumode :math:`k`.

Non-Gaussian CV operations and observables are currently only supported via the finite difference
method of gradient computation.
