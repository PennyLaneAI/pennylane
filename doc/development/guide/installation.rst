Installation and dependencies
=============================

Dependencies
------------

PennyLane requires the following libraries be installed:

* `Python <http://python.org/>`_ >= 3.6

as well as the following Python packages:

* `numpy <http://numpy.org/>`_ >= 1.13.3
* `scipy <http://scipy.org/>`_ >= 1.0.0
* `NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/>`_ >= 1.0.0
* `autograd <https://github.com/HIPS/autograd>`_
* `toml <https://github.com/uiri/toml>`_
* `appdirs <https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs>`_
* `semantic-version <https://github.com/rbarrois/python-semanticversion>`_ == 2.6

The following Python packages are optional:

* `dask["parallel"] <https://dask.org/>`_, for parallel QNodeCollection execution
* `tensornetwork <https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork>`_ >= 0.3, for the ``default.tensor`` plugin

If you currently do not have Python 3 installed, we recommend
`Anaconda for Python 3 <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_, a distributed version
of Python packaged for scientific computation.

.. _install_interfaces:

Interface dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For development of the TensorFlow and PyTorch interfaces, additional
requirements are required.

* **PyTorch interface**: ``pytorch >= 1.1``

* **TensorFlow interface**: ``tensorflow >= 1.15``

  Note that any version of TensorFlow supporting eager execution mode
  is supported, however there are slight differences between the eager
  API in TensorFlow 1.X versus 2.X.

  Make sure that all modifications and tests involving the TensorFlow
  interface work for both TensorFlow 1.X and 2.X!

  This includes:

  - If ``tf.__version__[0] == "1"``, running ``tf.enable_eager_execution()``
    before execution.

  - Only using the ``tf.GradientTape`` context for gradient computation.

QChem dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, for development of the QChem package, the following dependencies
are required:

* `OpenFermion <https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion>`__ >= 0.10

* `pySCF <https://sunqm.github.io/pyscf>`__
  and `OpenFermion-PySCF <https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-pyscf>`__ >= 0.4

* `Psi4 <http://www.psicode.org/>`__ and
  `OpenFermion-Psi4 <https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-Psi4>`__ >= 0.4
  (optional but recommended to run the full test suite)

  The easiest way to install Psi4 is via Ananconda:

  .. code-block:: bash

    conda install psi4 psi4-rt -c psi4

* `Open Babel <https://openbabel.org>`__ (optional but recommended to run the full test suite)

  Open Babel can be installed using ``apt`` if on Ubuntu/Debian:

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt install openbabel

  or using Anaconda:

  .. code-block:: bash

      conda install -c conda-forge openbabel

Installation
------------

For development purposes, it is recommended to install PennyLane source code
using development mode:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane
    cd pennylane
    pip install -e .

If also developing for the QChem package, this will need to installed as well:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e qchem

The ``-e`` flag ensures that edits to the source code will be reflected when
importing PennyLane in Python.


.. note::

    Due to the use of :ref:`entry points <installing_plugin>` to install
    plugins, changes to PennyLane device class locations or shortnames
    requires ``pip install -e .`` to be re-run in the plugin repository
    for the changes to take effect.
