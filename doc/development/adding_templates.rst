Contributing templates
======================

The following steps will help you to add your favourite circuit ansatz to
PennyLane's :mod:`template <pennylane.template>` library.

.. note::

    PennyLane internally loosely distinguishes :doc:`different types </introduction/templates>` of templates, such as
    :mod:`embeddings <pennylane.templates.embeddings>`, :mod:`layers <pennylane.templates.layers>`,
    :mod:`state_preparations <pennylane.templates.state_preparations>` or
    :mod:`subroutines <pennylane.templates.subroutines>`. Below you need to replace ``<templ_type>`` with the
    correct template type.

Templates are just gates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conceptually, there is no difference in PennyLane between a template or ansatz and a :doc:`operation </introduction/operations>`.
Both inherit from the :class:`Operation <pennylane.operation.Operation>` class, which has an ``expand()`` function
that can be used to define a decomposition into other gates. If a device does not recognise the name of the operation,
it calls the ``expand()`` function which returns a :class:`tape <pennylane.tape.QuantumTape>` instance that
represents the queue of the decomposing gates.

For example, the following shows a simple template for a layer of of Pauli-X rotations:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml
    from pennylane.operation import Operation, AnyWires

    class MyNewTemplate(Operation):

        num_params = 1
        num_wires = AnyWires
        par_domain = "A"  # note: this attribute will be deprecated soon

        def expand(self):

            # extract the weights as the first parameter
            # passed to this operation
            weights = self.parameters[0]

            # extract the length of the weights vector using
            # the interface-agnostic `math` module
            num_weights = qml.math.shape(weights)[0]

            # record the ansatz in a tape
            with qml.tape.QuantumTape() as tape:

                for i in range(num_weights):
                    qml.RX(weights[i], wires=self.wires[i])

            return tape


The ``num_params`` and ``num_wires`` class attributes determine that an instance of this template can be created
by passing a single parameter (of arbitrary shape and type), as well as an arbitrary number of wires:

.. code-block:: python

    weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
    MyNewTemplate(weights, wires=['a', 'b', 'd'])

As an ``Operation``, templates can define other methods and attributes, such as a matrix representation,
a generator, or even a gradient rule.

.. note::

    In principle, templates could also inherit from the :class:`Observable <pennylane.operation.Observable>`
    class and define a sequence of diagonalising gates as an ansatz.

Classical pre-processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Templates often perform extensive pre-processing on the arguments they receive.

Any substantial pre-processing should be implemented by overwriting the ``__init__`` function of the ``Operator`` class.
This also allows us to define templates with more flexible signatures than the ``(*params, wires)``
signature expected by the ``Operator`` class.

As an illustration, let us extend ``MyNewTemplate`` and check that the first
parameter it receives is one-dimensional, apply a sine function to each weight,
and invert the wires that the operation acts on.

.. code-block:: python

    def MyNewTemplate(Operation):

        num_params = 1
        num_wires = AnyWires
        par_domain = "A"  # note: this attribute will be deprecated soon

        def __init__(weights, raw_wires)

            shp = qml.math.shape(weights)
            if len(shp) != 1:
                raise ValueError("Expected one-dimensional weights tensor.")

            # pre-process weights
            new_weights = qml.math.sin(weights)

            # pre-process wires
            inverted_wires = wires[::-1]

            # initialise operation with pre-processed parameters and wires
            super().__init__(new_weights, wires=inverted_wires)


        def expand(self):

            weights = self.parameters[0]
            num_weights = qml.math.shape(weights)[0]

            with qml.tape.QuantumTape() as tape:
                for i in range(num_weights):
                    qml.RX(weights[i], wires=self.wires[i])

            return tape

The ``parameters`` and ``wires`` attributes used in the ``expand()`` function
refer to the ``new_weights`` and ``inverted_wires`` that were used to initialize the parent class.

The template design should make as many arguments differentiable as possible.
Differentiable arguments are always tensors of the allowed :doc:`interfaces </introduction/interfaces>`,
such as ``tf.Variable``, or ``pennylane.numpy.array``.
This means that we have to process them with interface-agnostic pre-processing methods inside the templates.
A lot of functionality
is provided by the :mod:`pennylane.math` module - for example, the length of the weights in the code above
was computed with the ``qml.math.shape(weights)`` function, since some tensor types do not support ``len(weights)``.

.. note::

    To retrieve elements from a tensor, keep in mind that not all tensor types support
    iteration.
    
    - Avoid expressions like ``for w in weights`` and
      rather iterate over ranges like ``for i in range(num_weights)``.
      
    - When indexing into the tensor, use multi-indexing where possible --- expressions
      like ``weights[6][5][2]`` are usually a lot slower than ``weights[6, 5, 2]``.


Adding the template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the template by adding a new file ``my_new_template.py`` to the correct ``templates/<templ_type>/``
subdirectory. The file contains your new template class.

Make sure you consider the following:

* *Choose the name carefully.* Good names tell the user what a template is used for,
  or what architecture it implements. The class name (i.e., ``MyNewTemplate``) is written in camel case.

* *Explicit decompositions.* Try to implement the decomposition in the ``expand()`` function
  without the use of convenient methods like the :func:`~.broadcast` function - this avoids
  unnecessary overhead.

* *Write an extensive docstring that explains how to use the template.* Include a sketch of the template (add the
  file to the ``doc/_static/templates/<templ_type>/`` directory). You should also display a small usage example
  at the beginning of the docstring. If you want to explain the behaviour in more detail, add a section starting
  with the ``.. UsageDetails::`` directive at the end of the docstring.
  Use the docstring of one of the existing templates for inspiration, such as
  :func:`AmplitudeEmbedding <pennylane.templates.embeddings.AmplitudeEmbedding>`.

* *Input checks.* While checking the inputs of the template for consistency introduces an overhead and should be
  kept to a minimum, it is still advised to do some basic sanity checks, for example making sure that the shape of the
  parameters is correct.

Importing the new template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import the new template in ``templates/<templ_type>/__init__.py`` by adding the new line

.. code-block:: python

    from .mynewtemplate import MyNewTemplate

Adding your template to the documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add your template to the documentation by adding a ``customgalleryitem`` to the correct layer type section in
``doc/introduction/templates.rst``:

.. code-block::

  .. customgalleryitem::
    :link: ../code/api/pennylane.templates.<templ_type>.MyNewTemplate.html
    :description: MyNewTemplate
    :figure: ../_static/templates/<templ_type>/my_new_template.png

.. note::

  This loads the image of the template added to ``doc/_static/templates/test_<templ_type>/``. Make sure that
  this image has the same dimensions and style as other template icons in the folder.

Adding tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't forget to add tests for your new template to the test suite. Create a separate file
``tests/templates/<templ_type>/test_my_new_template.py`` with all tests.
You can draw some inspiration from :mod:`existing tests <tests/templates/test_embeddings/test_qaoa_emb>`.
