Quantum embeddings
===================

A *quantum embedding* represents classical data as quantum states in a Hilbert space via a *quantum
feature map*. It takes a classical datapoint :math:`x` and translates it into a set of gate
parameters in a quantum circuit, creating a quantum state :math:`| \psi_x \rangle`. This process is
a crucial part of designing quantum algorithms and affects their computational powerâ€”for more
details, see :cite:`schuld2018supervised` and :cite:`schuld2018quantum`. 

Let's consider classical input data consisting of :math:`M` examples, with :math:`N` features each, 

.. math:: \mathcal{D}=\{x^{(1)}, \ldots, x^{(m)}, \ldots, x^{(M)}\},

where :math:`x^{(m)}` is a :math:`N`-dimensional vector for :math:`m=1,\ldots,M`. To embed this data
into :math:`n` quantum subsystems (:math:`n` qubits *or* :math:`n` qumodes for discrete- and
continuous-variable quantum computing, respectively), we can use various embedding techniques, some
of which are explained briefly below. 


Basis Embedding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basis embedding associates each input with a computational basis state of a qubit system. Therefore,
classical data has to be in the form of binary strings. The embedded quantum state is the bit-wise
translation of a binary string to the corresponding states of the quantum subsystems. For example,
:math:`x=1001` is represented by the 4-qubit quantum state :math:`| 1001 \rangle`. Hence, one bit of
classical information is represented by one quantum subsystem.

Let's consider the classical dataset :math:`\mathcal{D}` mentioned above. For basis embedding, each
example has to be a N-bit binary string; :math:`x^{(m)}=(b_1,\ldots,b_N)` with :math:`b_i \in \{0,1\}`
for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N`. Assuming all features are represented with unit binary precision (one bit),
each input example :math:`x^{(m)}` can be directly mapped to the quantum state :math:`| x^{(m)}\rangle`. **This means that the number of quantum subsystems,** :math:`\bm{n}` **, must be at least equal to** :math:`\bm{N}`. An entire dataset can be represented in superpositions of computational
basis states as

.. math:: | \mathcal{D} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} \sum_{m=1}^{M} |x^{(m)} \rangle.

For example, let's say we have a classical dataset containing two examples :math:`x^{(1)}=01`
and :math:`x^{(2)}=11`. The corresponding basis encoding uses two qubits to represent :math:`| x^{(1)} \rangle=|01 \rangle` and :math:`| x^{(2)} \rangle=|11 \rangle`, resulting in

.. math:: | \mathcal{D} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|01 \rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |11 \rangle.

.. note:: For :math:`N` bits, there are :math:`2^N` possible basis states. Given :math:`M \ll 2^N`, the basis embedding of :math:`\mathcal{D}` will be sparse. 


Amplitude Embedding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the amplitude-embedding technique, data is encoded into the amplitudes of a quantum state. A
normalized classical :math:`N`-dimensional datapoint :math:`x` is represented by the amplitudes of
a :math:`n`-qubit quantum state :math:`| \psi_x \rangle` as

.. math:: | \psi_x \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i |i \rangle,

where :math:`N=2^n`, :math:`x_i` is the :math:`i`-th element of :math:`x`, and :math:`| i \rangle` is
the :math:`i`-th computational basis state. In this case, however, :math:`x_i` can have different numeric
data types, e.g., integer or floating point. For example, let's say we want to encode the four-dimensional
floating-point array :math:`x=(1.0, 0.0, -5.5, 0.0)` using amplitude embedding. The first step is to normalize it, i.e., :math:`x_{norm}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{31.25}}(1.0, 0.0, -5.5, 0.0)`. The corresponding amplitude encoding uses two qubits to represent :math:`x_{norm}` as

.. math:: | \psi_{x_{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{31.25}}\left[|00 \rangle - 5.5|10 \rangle\right].  

Let's consider the classical dataset :math:`\mathcal{D}` mentioned above. Its amplitude embedding
can be easily understood if we concatenate all the input examples :math:`x^{(m)}` together into one
vector, i.e., 

.. math:: \alpha = C_{norm} \{ x^{(1)}_1, \ldots, x^{(1)}_N, x^{(2)}_1, \ldots, x^{(2)}_N, \ldots, x^{(M)}_1, \ldots, x^{(M)}_N \},
 
where :math:`C_{norm}` is the normalization constant; this vector must be normalized :math:`|\alpha|^2=1`. The input dataset can now be represented in the computational basis as

.. math:: | \mathcal{D} \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{2^n} \alpha_i |i \rangle,

where :math:`\alpha_i` are the elements of the amplitude vector :math:`\alpha` and :math:`| i \rangle`
are the computational basis states. The number of amplitudes to be encoded is :math:`N \times M`. 
As a system of :math:`n` qubits provides :math:`2^n` amplitudes, **amplitude embedding requires** :math:`\bm{n \geq \log_2({NM})}`  **qubits.**


.. note::
    If the total number of amplitudes to embed, i.e., :math:`N \times M`, is less than
    :math:`2^n`, *non-informative* constants can be *padded* to :math:`\alpha`
    :cite:`schuld2018supervised`.
    
    For example, if we have 3 examples with 2 features each, we have
    :math:`3\times 2= 6` amplitudes to embed. However, we have to use at least
    :math:`\lceil \log_2(6)\rceil = 3` qubits, with :math:`2^3=8` available states. We
    therefore have to concatenate :math:`2^3-6=2` constants at the end of :math:`\alpha`. 


.. important::
    There are many other embedding techniques with similar embedding protocols.
    For example, *squeezing embedding* and *displacement embedding* are used
    with continuous-variable quantum computing models, where classical information
    is encoded in the squeezing and displacement operator parameters.
    *Hamiltonian embedding* uses an implicit technique by encoding information in the
    evolution of a quantum system :cite:`schuld2018supervised`.
