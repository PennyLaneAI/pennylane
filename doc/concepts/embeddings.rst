Quantum embeddings
===================

A *Quantum Embedding* represents classical data as quantum states in a Hilbert space via a *quantum feature map*. An embedding takes a classical datapoint :math:`x` and translates it into a set of gate parameters in a quantum circuit, creating a quantum state :math:`\mid \psi_x \rangle`. This process is a crucial part of designing quantum algorithms and affects their computational powerâ€”for more details, see :cite:`schuld2018supervised` and :cite:`schuld2018quantum`. 

Let's consider classical input data consisting of :math:`M` examples, with :math:`N` features each, 

.. math:: \mathcal{D}=\{x^{(1)}, \ldots, x^{(M)}\},

where :math:`x^{(m)}` is a :math:`N`-dimensional vector for :math:`m=1,\ldots,M`. To embed this data into :math:`n` quantum subsystems (:math:`n` qubits *or* :math:`n` qumodes for discrete- and continuous-variable quantum computing, respectively), we can use various embedding techniques, some of which are explained briefly below. 


Basis Embedding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basis embedding associates each input with a computational basis state of a qubit system. Therefore, classical data has to be in the form of binary strings. The embedded quantum state is the bit-wise translation of a binary string to the corresponding states of the quantum subsystems. For example, :math:`x=1001` is represented by the 4-qubit quantum state :math:`\mid 1001 \rangle`. Hence, one bit of classical information is represented by one quantum subsystem.

Let's consider the classical dataset :math:`\mathcal{D}` mentioned above. For basis embedding, each example has to be a N-bit binary string; :math:`x^{(m)}=(b_1,\ldots,b_N)` with :math:`b_i \in \{0,1\}` for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N`. Assuming all features are repesented with unit binary precision (one bit), each input example :math:`x^{(m)}` can be directly mapped to the quantum state :math:`\mid x^{(m)}\rangle`. **This means that the number of quantum subsystems,** :math:`\bm{n}` **, must be at least equal to** :math:`\bm{N}`. An entire dataset can be represented in superpositions of computational basis states as


.. math:: \mid \mathcal{D} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} \sum_{m=1}^{M} |x^{(m)} \rangle.

For example, let's say we have a classical dataset containing two examples :math:`x^{(1)}=01` and :math:`x^{(2)}=11`. The corresponding basis encoding uses two qubits to represent :math:`\mid x^{(1)} \rangle=|01 \rangle` and :math:`\mid x^{(2)} \rangle=|11 \rangle` resulting in

.. math:: \mid \mathcal{D} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|01 \rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |11 \rangle.

.. note:: For :math:`N` bits, there are :math:`2^N` possible basis states. Given :math:`M \ll 2^N`, the basis embedding of :math:`\mathcal{D}` will be sparse :cite:`schuld2018supervised`. 


Amplitude Embedding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the amplitude embedding technique, data is encoded into the amplitudes of a quantum state. A classical **normalized** :math:`N`-dimensional datapoint :math:`x` is represented by the amplitudes of a :math:`n`-qubit quantum state :math:`\mid \psi_x \rangle` as

.. math:: \mid \psi_x \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i |i \rangle,

where :math:`N=2^n`, :math:`x_i` is the :math:`i`'th element of :math:`x` and :math:`\mid i \rangle` is the :math:`i`'th computational basis state. For example, let's say we want to encode :math:`x=1010` using amplitude embedding. The first step is to normalize it, i.e., :math:`x_{norm}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1010)`. The corresponding amplitude encoding uses two qubits to represent :math:`x_{norm}` as

.. math:: \mid \psi_{x_{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|00 \rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|10 \rangle.  

Let's consider the classical dataset :math:`\mathcal{D}` mentioned above. Its amplitude embedding can be easily understood if we concatenate all the input examples :math:`x^{(m)}` together into one vector, i.e., 

.. math:: \alpha = C_{norm} \{ x^{(1)}_1, \ldots, x^{(1)}_N, x^{(2)}_1, \ldots, x^{(2)}_N, \ldots, x^{(M)}_1, \ldots, x^{(M)}_N \},
 
where :math:`C_{norm}` is the normalization constant; this vector must be normalized :math:`|\alpha|^2=1`. The input dataset can now be represented in the computational basis as

.. math:: \mid \mathcal{D} \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{2^n} \alpha_i |i \rangle,

where :math:`\alpha_i` are the elements of amplitude vector :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\mid i \rangle` are the computational basis states. The number of amplitudes to be encoded are :math:`N \times M`. As a system of :math:`n` qubits provides :math:`2^n` amplitudes, **amplitude embedding requires** :math:`\bm{n \geq \log_2({NM})}`  **qubits.**


.. note:: If the total number of amplitudes to embed, i.e., :math:`N \times M`, is less less than :math:`2^n`, *non-informative* constants can be *padded* to :math:`\alpha `:cite:`schuld2018supervised`. For example, if we have three examples with two features each, we have six amplitudes to embed. However, as we have to use at least three qubits, we have to concatenate two constants at the end of :math:`\alpha`. 

.. important:: There are many other embedding techniques with similar embedding protocols. For example, *Squeezing embedding* and *Displacement embedding* are used with continuous-variable quantum computing models, where classical information is encoded in the squeezing and displacement operator parameters. *Hamiltonian embedding* uses an implicit technique by encoding information in the evolution of a quantum system :cite:`schuld2018supervised`.
