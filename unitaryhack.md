</p>

### What is it?

unitaryHACK is a open-souce hackathon running May 14-30th, 2021. Contribute to open-source projects 
in the quantum computing space, learn new skills, and earn some sweet swag and bounties!

### How can I take part?

A number of quantum open-source projects are participating in unitaryHACK. You can find a comprehensive 
list at the [unitaryHACK website](https://unitaryfund.github.io/unitaryhack/participating-projects.html). 

If you'd like to contribute to PennyLane during unitaryHACK, we have marked a number of existing issues 
with the ``unitaryhack`` tag.

### Which issues are available?

Issues for all skill and experience levels are available, from updating documentation to adding new simulators. 
Look for ``[unitaryhack]`` in the issue's title, or [filter by the ``unitaryhack`` label](https://github.com/pennylaneai/pennylane/labels/unitaryhack).

If you're interested in claiming a cash prize, the following issue has a $100 bounty up for grabs:
