<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/master/doc/_static/code.png" width="400px" align="right">

- <strong>*Program quantum computers*</strong>. Build quantum circuits with a wide range of state preparations, gates, and measurements. Run on [high-performance simulators](https://pennylane.ai/performance/) or [various hardware devices](https://pennylane.ai/plugins/), with advanced features like mid-circuit measurements and error mitigation.

- <strong>*Master quantum algorithms*</strong>. From NISQ to fault-tolerant quantum computing, unlock algorithms for research and application. Analyze performance, visualize circuits, and access tools for [quantum chemistry](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/chemistry.html) and [algorithm development](https://pennylane.ai/search/?contentType=DEMO&categories=algorithms&sort=publication_date).

- <strong>*Machine learning with quantum hardware and simulators*</strong>. Integrate with **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **JAX**, **Keras**, or **NumPy** to define and train hybrid models using quantum-aware optimizers and hardware-compatible gradients for advanced research tasks. [Quantum machine learning quickstart](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/interfaces.html).


- <strong>*Quantum datasets*</strong>. Access high-quality, pre-simulated datasets to decrease time-to-research and accelerate algorithm development. [Browse the datasets](https://pennylane.ai/datasets/) or contribute your own data.


- <strong>*Compilation and performance*</strong>. Experimental support for just-in-time
  compilation. Compile your entire hybrid workflow, with support for 
  advanced features such as adaptive circuits, real-time measurement 
  feedback, and unbounded loops. See
  [Catalyst](https://github.com/pennylaneai/catalyst) for more details.
