# Simulating $H = H_0 + \alpha H_1$ via product formulas

This folder contains the simulation of Hamiltonians of the form $H = H_0 + \alpha H_1$ via two leading methods proposed in the literature:

1. Interaction picture, in combination with Magnus (or CFQMs).
2. Near-integrable techniques.

Our goal is to showcase when one method may be more performant than another.
