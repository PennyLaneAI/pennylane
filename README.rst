`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is a full-stack Python library for quantum machine
learning and automatic differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical computations.



Features
========

- **Follow the gradient**. Built-in **automatic differentiation** of quantum circuits

- **Best of both worlds**. Support for **hybrid quantum & classical** models

- **Batteries included**. Provides **optimization and machine learning** tools

- **Device independent**. The same quantum circuit model can be **run on different backends**

- **Large plugin ecosystem**. Install plugins to run your computational circuits on more devices, including `Strawberry Fields <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-sf>`_ and `ProjectQ <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-pq>`_



Installation
============

PennyLane requires Python version 3.5 and above. Installation of PennyLane, as well as all dependencies, can be done using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install pennylane


Getting started
===============

For getting started with PennyLane, check out our `qubit rotation <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/qubit_rotation.html>`_, `photon redirection <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/photon_redirection.html>`_, `quantum GAN <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/quantum_gan.html>`_, and other machine learning tutorials.

Our `documentation <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is also a great starting point to familiarize yourself with the hybrid classical-quantum machine learning approach, and explore the available optimization tools provided by PennyLane. Play around with the numerous devices and plugins available for running your hybrid optimizations - these include the IBM QX4 quantum chip, provided by the `PennyLane-PQ <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-pq>`_ plugin.

Finally, detailed documentation on the PennyLane API is provided, for full details on available quantum operations and expectations, and detailed guides on `how to write your own <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/overview.html>`_ PennyLane-compatible quantum device.
