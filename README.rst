`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is a full-stack Python library for quantum machine
learning and automatic differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical computations.


.. todo:: Update badges to point to PennyLane CI services.


Features
========

- *Follow the gradient*: an open-source Python library for **automatic differentiation** of quantum circuits

- *Best of both worlds*: support for **hybrid quantum and classical** computational models

- *Batteries included*: built-in **optimization and machine learning** tools

- *Device independent*: the same quantum circuit model can be **run on different devices**

- *Large plugin ecosystem*: install plugins to run your computational circuits on more devices,
  including `Strawberry Fields <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-sf>`_ and
  `ProjectQ <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-pq>`_



Installation
============

PennyLane requires Python version 3.5 and above. Installation of PennyLane, as well as all dependencies, can be done using pip:
