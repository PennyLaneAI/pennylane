    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/master/doc/_static/code.png" width="300px"  align="right">

- *Device independent*.
  Access quantum hardware and simulators from **Xanadu Strawberry Fields**, **IBM Q**, **Google Cirq**, **Rigetti Forest**, and
  **Microsoft QDK**.

- *Best of both worlds*.
  Build hybrid models by connecting quantum hardware to **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **NumPy**.

- *Follow the gradient*. Hardware-friendly **automatic differentiation** of quantum circuits.

- *Batteries included*. Built-in tools for **quantum machine learning**, **optimization**, and **quantum chemistry**.

Getting started
===============

For an introduction to quantum machine learning, we have several guides and resources available
on PennyLane's `quantum machine learning page <https://pennylane.ai/qml/>`_:

* `What is quantum machine learning? <https://pennylane.ai/qml/whatisqml.html>`_
* `QML tutorials and demonstrations <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demonstrations.html>`_
* `Frequently asked questions <https://pennylane.ai/faq.html>`_
* `Glossary of key concepts <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary.html>`_
* `Curated selection of QML videos <https://pennylane.ai/qml/videos.html>`_

You can also check out our `documentation <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ for
`quickstart guides <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/pennylane.html>`_
to using PennyLane, and detailed developer guides on
