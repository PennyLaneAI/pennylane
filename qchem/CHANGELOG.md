# Release 0.10.0 (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* The function ``hf_state`` outputs an array with the occupation-number
  representation of the Hartree-Fock (HF) state. This function can be used to
  set the qubit register to encode the HF state which is the typical starting
  point for quantum chemistry simulations using the VQE algorithm.
