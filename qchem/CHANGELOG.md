# Release 0.11.0

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Adds the function `qml.qchem.particle_number`, which computes the particle
  number operator of a given molecule.
  [(#698)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/698)

* The function ``get_spinZ_matrix_elements`` has been added to the
  ``obs`` module to generate the matrix elements required to build
  the total-spin projection operator by using the generic function
  ``observable`` as implemented in the same module.
  [(#696)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/696)

* The new module ``obs`` has been added to build many-body operators
  whose expectation values can be computed in PennyLane to simulate
  properties of interest of quantum systems. In particular, this PR adds
  the required functions to build the total-spin operator S^2. The adopted
  methodology is very general and is not restricted to molecular systems.
  [(#689)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/689)

* The new function ``excitations_to_wires`` has been implemented to map the particle-hole
  representations ph and pphh, generated by ``sd_excitations``, to the wires that the
  qchem templates act on. This implementation enables compliance with the
  generalized PennyLane templates required to build the UCCSD VQE ansatz.
  [(#679)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/679)

  For example:

  ```pycon
  >>> n_electrons = 2
  >>> n_spinorbitals = 4
  >>> ph_confs, pphh_confs = sd_excitations(n_electrons, n_spinorbitals)
  >>> print(ph_confs)
  [[0, 2], [1, 3]]
  >>> print(pphh_confs)
  [[0, 1, 2, 3]]

  >>> wires=['a0', 'b1', 'c2', 'd3']
  >>> ph, pphh = excitations_to_wires(ph_confs, pphh_confs, wires=wires)
  >>> print(ph)
  [['a0', 'b1', 'c2'], ['b1', 'c2', 'd3']]
  >>> print(pphh)
  [[['a0', 'b1'], ['c2', 'd3']]]
  ```

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* The naming convention used in the `structure` module has been propagated
  to the `obs` module.
  [(#759)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/759)

  The changes include:

  - `n_electrons` renamed to `electrons`.
  - `n_orbitals` renamed to `orbitals`.

  In addition, the argument `orbitals` is used now to pass the number of *spin*
  orbitals.

* The functions involved in observable conversions from/to OpenFermion now accept
  a new `wires` argument that can be used to specify the qubits-to-wires mapping
  when custom wires are used in Pennylane ansatz.
  [(#750)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/750)

* The functions involved in generating the single and double excitations from a
  a Hartree-Fock state and mapping them to the wires that the Unitary
  Coupled-Cluster (UCCSD) ansatz act on have been improved, with a more
  consistent naming convention and improved docstrings.
  [(#742)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/742)  

  The changes include:

  - `sd_excitations` has been renamed to `excitations`.

  - The names of internal variables and arguments have been standardized
    to avoid using different languages mixing the terminologies
    "single/double excitations" and "particle-hole excitations".

  - The arguments of the function `excitations_to_wires` have been renamed.
    `ph_confs` → `singles`, `pphh_confs` → `doubles`

* The functions involved in the construction of the electronic Hamiltonian have been
  improved, with shorter names and improved docstrings, including adding complementary
  information to better explain the basics of quantum chemistry.
  [(#735)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/735)

  The changes include:

  - `active_space` is now independent of the OpenFermion `MolecularData` data structure.

  - `meanfield_data` has been renamed to `meanfield`, and modified to return
    the absolute path to the file with the meanfield electronic structure of the molecule.

  - `decompose_hamiltonian` has been renamed to `decompose`,
    due to the new `qml.utils.decompose_hamiltonian` function. This function has also been
    marked for deprecation.

  - `generate_hamiltonian` has been renamed to `molecular_hamiltonian`.
    The modified function contains an extended docstring that outlines the main steps to build the Hamiltonian.

  In addition to the above changes, function arguments have also been modified and improved; please
  see relevant function docstrings for more details.

* The total spin observable S^2 can be built straightforwardly using the
  function `spin2` as implemented in the `obs` module.
  [(#714)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/714)

* The total-spin projection observable S_z can be built straightforwardly using the
  function `spin_z` as implemented in the `obs` module.
  [(#711)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/711)

# Release 0.10.0

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* The function ``hf_state`` outputs an array with the occupation-number
  representation of the Hartree-Fock (HF) state. This function can be used to
  set the qubit register to encode the HF state which is the typical starting
  point for quantum chemistry simulations using the VQE algorithm.
  [(#629)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/629)

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* The function ``convert_hamiltonian`` has been renamed to ``convert_observable``
  since it can be used to convert any OpenFermion QubitOperator to a PennyLane
  Observable. ``convert_observable`` will be used in the ``obs`` module to build
  observables linked to molecular properties.
  [(#677)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane/pull/677)

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* Removes support for Python 3.5.
