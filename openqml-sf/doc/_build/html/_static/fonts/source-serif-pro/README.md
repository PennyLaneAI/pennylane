# Source Serif Pro

Source Serif Pro is a set of OpenType fonts to complement the [Source Sans Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro) family. 
In addition to a functional OpenType font, this open source project provides all of the source files that were used to build this OpenType font by using the AFDKO makeotf tool.
